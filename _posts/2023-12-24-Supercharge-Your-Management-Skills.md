"Leaders Eat Last" by Simon Sinek explores the dynamics of successful leadership by delving into the biological and anthropological roots of human behavior within organizations.

Sinek argues that great leaders prioritize the well-being of their teams, embodying a selfless and supportive leadership style. Drawing on examples from various companies and military units, he highlights the importance of creating a culture of trust, collaboration, and shared values.

The title itself encapsulates a key theme – leaders who prioritize the needs of their team, putting their well-being ahead of personal gain, ultimately foster loyalty and dedication. Sinek emphasizes the significance of providing a sense of purpose and belonging to employees, creating an environment where individuals feel secure and valued. By examining the neurochemical aspects of human interaction, the book underscores the biological basis for trust and cooperation.

The book goes beyond traditional leadership paradigms, urging readers to consider the impact of leadership on the overall well-being of individuals and organizations. [Leaders Eat Last](https://amzn.to/3TnSvVQ) is a great book for new and established managers.

"How to Fail" is a candid and humorous exploration of the author Elizabeth Day's personal journey through failure. Drawing from her own experiences and those of various successful individuals, Day dismantles societal perceptions of failure and reframes it as a necessary and transformative part of life. The book challenges the conventional notion that success is the only acceptable outcome and celebrates the valuable lessons that can be gleaned from setbacks.

Through a series of insightful anecdotes, Day shares her own failures and reflects on the resilience and self-discovery that ensued. She emphasizes that embracing failure is not a sign of weakness, but rather a powerful tool for growth and self-awareness. The narrative weaves together elements of memoir, self-help, and cultural commentary, providing a refreshing perspective on the inevitability of failure and the importance of resilience.

Elizabeth Day encourages readers to redefine their relationship with failure, fostering a mindset that allows for experimentation, learning, and ultimately, success. With wit and wisdom, she inspires individuals to view setbacks not as roadblocks, but as stepping stones towards a more authentic and fulfilling life.

To me, [How to Fail](https://amzn.to/3RIn1Zy) is a great book about how to deal with failure.

{: .text-center}

Agile project management is a revolutionary shift in the planning and execution of projects, particularly in software development, as outlined in the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/). This insightful book introduces the widely embraced SCRUM method, authored by one of its founders, Jeff Sutherland. While initially tailored for software development, SCRUM's adaptability extends to diverse fields such as construction and personal projects.

At the core of SCRUM are its principles, notably the sprint – a fixed timeframe spanning 2 to 4 weeks, during which a project team collaboratively engages in sprint planning to define tasks and to-dos. This method transcends its original domain, proving to be a potent approach for expediting projects and enhancing outcomes. Jeff Sutherland's book, [Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time](https://amzn.to/46J8WQI), offers an in-depth exploration of SCRUM, making it an invaluable resource for those seeking a comprehensive understanding of this effective project management methodology.

## 7 Habits of Highly Effective People

This book is an indispensable reference in discussions about productivity, consistently ranking at the pinnacle of management literature. Its compelling insights draw readers into a transformative journey.

At its core, the narrative explores paradigms – the external influences shaping our worldview. A shift in perspective, illustrated through captivating stories, can yield remarkable results. Stephen Covey champions the "inside-out" approach, encouraging proactivity and self-reliance. The introduction of seven habits initiates a progression from independence to interdependence, underscoring the potency of teamwork.

Structured around two victories, the book describes the private victory (comprising the first three habits) and the public victory (encompassing the next three habits). The final habit, "renewal," encapsulates self-improvement, encompassing physical fitness, spiritual pursuits, continuous mental growth, and the pursuit of win-win solutions.

Stephen Covey's teachings offer a roadmap for personal and professional growth, making this book an essential read in the realm of productivity and effective leadership. I can highly recommend the [7 Habits of Highly Effective People](https://amzn.to/45DhUh0) to everyone interested in how to become more productive

## The Miracle of Appreciation

The German book "The Miracle of Appreciation" by Reinhard Haller delves into appreciation in an era marked by social detachment, emphasizing empathy's role in mental and physical well-being.

The book intertwines values and self-worth within Shalom H. Schwartz's framework, asserting that self-value is essential for appreciating others.

Reinhard Haller identifies topics such as humiliation, silence's destructive potential, narcissism as well as lack of empathy in our modern area. He highlights that praise and gratitude are important psychological factors and can lead to a sharp increase in motivation and productivity.

The German book can be seen a bit controversial, but to me “[The Miracle of Appreciation](https://amzn.to/3RIdbqz)” served as  greate alternative literature source in the realm of management and leadership literature
