Welcome!

This is my very first post. I am currently experimenting with github pages, Jekyll and the Theme Minimal Mistakes. I found it to be a great way of creating easy and minimalistic static webpages!

In the upcoming weeks I plan to post about the topics:
- personal productivity
- books I read recently

Stay curoios!
