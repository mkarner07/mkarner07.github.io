## Hi and welcome!

My name is Matthias Karner and what you are reading is my very first post.

I want to briefly tell you, why I created this webpage and started to write.

I've always had a deep passion for reading, which evolved into a profound appreciation for curated content. My academic journey nurtured this love for well-researched material, eventually leading me to venture into the world of scientific article writing during my dissertation. In recent years, my publishing output slowed as my career transitioned into the corporate world.

Nevertheless, one thing remained constant â€” I never stopped reading.

The books I read and my journey into the corporate world has allowed me to build a comprehensive knowledge base in various topics. This wealth of expertise and insights is something I'm eager to share through my writing, making it an opportune time to reignite my passion for creating and disseminating valuable content.

I decided to enter the realm of online writing.

In the upcoming weeks I plan to post about the topics:
- Personal Productivity
- Management and Leadership
- Digital Transformation of the Production

Stay curious!
