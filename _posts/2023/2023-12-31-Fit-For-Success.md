### 1. Unplug Autopilot

One of the biggest hurdles in finding a joyful career is our tendency to operate on autopilot. Many of us make quick career choices without reflecting on what truly makes us happy. 

Unplug the autopilot.

Instead start reflecting on what motivates and drives you.

### 2. Skip the Shiny Objects. Focus on values instead.

Don’t fall for "shiny objects" – external factors that might make a job seem appealing but don't contribute to long-term happiness such as status, job titles, or even a hefty salary. 

Instead identify and understand your core values. Focus on what you want to be known for.

You can use methods such as "Values Game" by Helen Tupper or “Workview and Lifeview” by Bill Burnett & Dave Evans.

### 3. Focus on your energy levels

Strengths are not just about what you excel at. They are tasks that energize you. Conversely, weaknesses are activities that drain your energy, even if you're good at them.

Do more of what brings you energy and leads to flow.

### 4. Be Career Curious and Do Prototyping

Be curios in exploring career possibilities.

You don’t have to make a drastic career change. Smaller changes within your current role or organization can lead to increased satisfaction.

Try prototyping and creating a career you love by starting where you are.

### 5. Help People Help You

Networking often carries a negative connotation. However, it is nothing different to seeking guidance and support.

Instead of asking someone to be your mentor, approach individuals for their specific insights. Generally people do want to help.
