In a [recent article]({% post_url 2023-11-09-Lean-into-Productivity %}), I delved into the exciting realm of translating lean manufacturing methods into the realm of personal productivity. The world of lean offers a treasure trove of techniques, and the response was so fantastic that I couldn't resist crafting a follow-up post. Brace yourself for a deep dive into even more game-changing methods that can revolutionize the way you approach your personal productivity!

## Genchi Genbutsu

The foundation of Lean Thinking can be traced back to the Japanese automotive industry, leading to the use of original Japanese language names for many of its methods. This is also the case for “Genchi Genbutsu”. The phrase translates to "go and see for yourself." It underscores the importance of firsthand experience and direct observation in understanding a situation.

Genchi Genbutsu recognizes that true insights arise from personal involvement and direct interaction with the actual environment - you won’t learn from just theory!

By being physically present, individuals can grasp the context, nuances, and intricacies that could be overlooked during a remote analysis.

An illustrative example is the development of the Sienna Minivan at Toyota. The chief product engineer Yuji Yokoya traveled extensively across the United States, covering over 53,000 miles to understand the needs and preferences of American consumers. This commitment to firsthand experience contributed significantly to the success of the Sienna Minivan.

In personal productivity, embracing Genchi Genbutsu means immersing yourself directly in your work environment. Go to the source of your productivity challenges: your workspace, or if you work in an industrial segment, go to the shopfloor. This hands-on approach provides insights that may be overlooked in theoretical planning. Genchi Genbutsu empowers you to optimize your personal productivity by being present and actively involved in the spaces where your work unfolds.

## Make use of the Minimum Viable Product

The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is a rather new concept within the realm of Lean Thinking and goes back to Eric Ries who is the famous author of [The Lean Startup]({% post_url 2023-11-02-Mastering-Innovation-The-Lean-Startup %}).

In the dynamic world of software development, the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) stands as a swift and cost-effective gateway to innovation. It's the compact, essential version of a finished product. Its compact design facilitates easy iterations, transforming it into a learning tool that enables customers to explore functionality. Meanwhile, developers can collect vital feedback for continuous enhancements.

But what's the secret sauce behind a successful MVP? It is simple: customer value.

Trim away the excess, focus on the core features that matter most to users, and embark on a collaborative feedback journey.

But you can apply the concept of MVP on your personal productivity as well. It is a close cousin to the Pareto Principle. Concentrate on the vital 20 % of tasks that yield 80 % of the results.

A to-do list often looks overwhelming. Breaking down significant challenges into smaller, manageable tasks can reduce the initial overwhelming feeling before getting started. This works even better if each finish task already provides a value on its own. Imagine softwaredevelopment: you can break down developing a new feature into functions - each function already providing value on their own.

The brilliance lies in the iterative process - refine and improve with each attempt, ensuring that your productivity remains aligned with your goals.

## Pull Principle

The Pull Principle is a cornerstone of Lean Manufacturing. It advocates for production based on actual demand rather than anticipation (aka “push principle”).

Applied to personal productivity, this principle can be a transformative approach. Instead of pushing yourself to complete tasks on a list, adopt a pull mindset. Focus on tasks based on immediate need and importance, mirroring the demand-driven ethos.

This doesn't imply that you should solely focus on tasks nearing their deadlines. Instead, it suggests selecting tasks based on your current energy and motivation levels. When energy is low, opt for tasks that yield quick wins, as small successes have the potential to boost your energy. Organizing tasks into different to-do lists allows you to choose the most suitable task based on your current energy and motivation levels.

Furthermore, you can use the Pull Principle’s customer focus: if you are overwhelmed by to-dos within a particular project, “pull” the tasks with the biggest customer value and work on them right away.

## Kanban

A method related to the Pull Principle is Kanban. Kanban (Japanease for “card”) is a visual management system that enhances efficiency by optimizing workflow. Initially Kanbans were used to mimic customer demand and establish a pull throughout the whole production.

Kanban already trancended its roots and can be a game-changer for task management. Each task becomes a card, progressing through the stages:

- To Do
- in Progress
- Done

When working in a team, visualizing all tasks on a common board provides clarity regarding the magnitude of the workload and indicates when prioritization is needed. This proves especially useful when a team collaborates on similar or related tasks. Establishing a team Kanban board, complete with swimlanes for each team member, ensures transparency by displaying all tasks and the current workload of each team member at all times.

Moreover, Kanban encourages continuous improvement. Regularly review your board, identify bottlenecks, and adjust your approach accordingly. If you find a workflow with more stages useful, just go for it!

## Plan-Do-Check-Act

A core value of Lean is to continuosly get better. The process for achieving this is the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle. It is somewhat similar to the Build-Measure-Learn cycle.

- **Plan**: Set goals and plan for change.
- **Do**: This step involves executing the plan on a small scale.
- **Check**: Assess results against objectives, distinguishing what works.
- **Act**: Optimize processes iteratively by implementing necessary changes.

PDCA is a dynamic tool, fostering adaptability and refinement in pursuit of efficiency and excellence.
