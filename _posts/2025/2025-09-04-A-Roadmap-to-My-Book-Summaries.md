Over the past few years, I’ve read a lot of books and for most of them, I’ve written short summaries. At first, these were just for me. They helped me quickly revisit the key ideas without having to reread the whole book.

But once I started this blog, I began sharing those summaries with you too.

Now that there are quite a few published, it’s getting harder to find them all in one place. So in this post, I’ve put together a simple roadmap to help you easily explore the summaries I’ve written so far.

## How to use the roadmap

One thing I’ve never liked about traditional folder systems is that each item can only live in one folder. But in real life, topics often connect to more than just one category. A book on leadership might also touch on productivity, communication, or even personal growth.

That’s why, for this roadmap, I’ve chosen a different approach. I’ve created several categories and each book summary is linked in every category it fits. This way, you don’t have to guess where a book might be filed. Just browse the category you're interested in, and you’ll find all the relevant summaries there.
