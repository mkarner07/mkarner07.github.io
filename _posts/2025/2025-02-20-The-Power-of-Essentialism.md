In today’s fast-paced world, being busy is a sign of success.

We fill our schedules with endless meetings, tasks, and commitments. But what if doing less could actually help us achieve more?

This is the core idea of Essentialism, a mindset that focuses on what truly matters and eliminates everything else. In this article, I’ll illuminate this topic by summarizing Greg McKeown’s book [Essentialism](https://gregmckeown.com/books/essentialism/).

## What Is Essentialism?

Essentialism is about focusing on the most important things and saying “no” to distractions.

Instead of trying to do everything, essentialists carefully choose what they commit to. This helps them use their energy, time, and resources more effectively.

The problem?

Success can be dangerous.

When we succeed, more people ask for our help. We say “yes” too often, and suddenly, we are overwhelmed with tasks that don’t matter. essentialism teaches us to be selective so we can focus on what truly brings value.

## How to think like an essentialist

### 1. You always have a choice

Many people believe they have no choice but to take on more work. However, essentialists understand that they always have the power to decide. They take control of their choices instead of letting others decide for them.

### 2. Most things don’t matter

Not everything is equally important.

Essentialists believe that only a few things truly matter, while most things are distractions. Instead of treating everything as urgent, they focus on the tasks that bring the most value.

### 3. Saying “No” is powerful

Every time we say “yes” to something unimportant, we say “no” to something important. Essentialists are comfortable saying “no” and setting boundaries. They use different ways to decline requests, such as:

- Saying “yes, but” and adjusting priorities.
- Suggesting someone else who can help.
- Using humor to soften the rejection.

## How to apply essentialism in daily life

### 1. Create space to think

We are often too busy to reflect on what truly matters. Essentialists take time to step back and think. This helps them make better decisions and focus on the right things.

### 2. Play and rest

Many people believe hard work means little sleep and no time for fun. However, studies show that play increases creativity, and sleep improves productivity. Essentialists protect their rest and allow time for creative activities.

### 3. Use clear criteria for decisions

To decide what to focus on, essentialists use a simple rule:

- If it’s not a “hell yes,” it’s a “no.”

They also use a decision-making model:

- **3 minimum criteria:** These must be met.
- **3 extreme criteria:** At least two must be met.

### 4. Set clear goals

Essentialists avoid vague goals. They set clear, measurable objectives. For example:

- Instead of saying, “We want to help people,” a clear goal would be: “We will build 150 houses in New Orleans.”

### 5. Remove unnecessary tasks

We often waste time on tasks that don’t add value. Essentialists experiment by removing tasks and seeing if anything changes. If nothing important is affected, they stop doing those tasks permanently.

### 6. Plan for unexpected problems

People often underestimate how long tasks take. Essentialists add a 50 % time buffer to their schedules. This prevents stress and helps them handle surprises more effectively.

### 7. Focus on progress, not perfection

Perfectionism slows us down. Essentialists believe “done is better than perfect.” They celebrate small wins because progress motivates us to keep going.

## The essentialist lifestyle

Living as an essentialist means being intentional about your time, energy, and focus. It means:

- Saying “no” more often.
- Prioritizing only the most valuable tasks.
- Protecting time for rest and creativity.
- Removing distractions and unnecessary tasks.

Essentialism is not about doing nothing.

It’s about doing the right things.

By focusing on what truly matters and eliminating distractions, we can achieve more with less stress. So next time you feel overwhelmed, ask yourself: *What is truly essential?* And let go of the rest.

## My personal opinion

I’d categorize myself more as a perfectionist than as an essentialist. However, I’ve found the topic very intriguing: the essentialist way can partially be a cure for perfectionism if we let it.

But at some points, essentialism seems a bit too much and even a bit abstract and disconnected from reality - that’s at least how I felt when I read [Essentialism](https://gregmckeown.com/books/essentialism/). Still, it was definitely worth the read to experience his viewpoint on the topic.
