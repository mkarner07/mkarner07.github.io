I’ve been writing online for 734 days now (160 articles). When I started my blog back in 2023, it was just an experiment. I had already read a lot and wanted to share some of my learnings (and maybe improve my English along the way).

But writing quickly became a habit.

A few months in, I noticed something interesting: I started seeing the world differently. New ideas and experiences weren’t just “new” - they became potential blog posts. I began thinking, *How could I write about this?*

And here’s the cool part: when you look at the world like that, you remember things better. Back in my master’s program, I was a tutor for mechanical engineering. Helping others understand the material always deepened my own understanding.

Writing works the same way.

When I take a new idea and turn it into an article, I don’t just learn it - it’s like carving them into memory.

Of course, writing is also a commitment. Creating something worth publishing takes time. Yes, there are great tools to help with editing, but writing, revising, and publishing still takes much more than just an hour and that’s not even counting the research.

That’s why I slowed down my [publishing pace](https://matthiaskarner.com/2024/10/I-Am-Changing-My-Publishing-Pace/) last year (from two articles a week to one). With a full-time job and a family, time and energy are limited. I didn’t want to burn out or quit writing altogether.

Publishing once a week still feels like a stretch sometimes, but it’s a good balance. It keeps me consistent without overwhelming me.

**Will I keep writing online?**

Yes.

I sincerely enjoy it.

And here’s the most important part: **thank you**. Thank you for visiting my blog and reading what I write. I started this for myself, but it means a lot that these words are actually being read by you.

If you’d like to connect, feel free to reach out on LinkedIn. I’d love to chat about leadership, personal productivity, or digital transformation.

Cheers and have a good one!
