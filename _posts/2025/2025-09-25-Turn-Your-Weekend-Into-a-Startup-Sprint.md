Did you ever dream of owning a  Lamborghini?

For many crypto investors and startup founders, it’s more than just a car. It’s a symbol of success. You’ve probably seen it in flashy YouTube ads, where self-proclaimed insiders use luxury lifestyles to sell courses, books, and get-rich-quick schemes.

But entrepreneurship doesn’t have to look like that. There’s a quieter, more grounded side to it. One that’s built on skills, thoughtful execution, and learning from solid sources - especially books.

Not too long ago, I’ve read [Million Dollar Weekend](https://www.google.com/search?q=Million+Dollar+Weekend) by Noah Kagan, and it’s one of those books that doesn’t just inspire. It pushes you to act.

And it’s not about building the next unicorn startup.

It’s about launching something real, fast, and profitable. Whether you're a first-time founder or just curious about entrepreneurship, this book delivers a solid framework.

So, if you are interested, let’s grab a coffee and dive in.

## Quick Summary for Those in a Hurry

Million Dollar Weekend is an entertaining book and it contains some motivational as well as helpful content.

In particular, author Noah Kagan focuses on the idea that you should just get started. You learn how to build a successful business by building businesses.

The insights into marketing are also very interesting. One thing in particular learning that stuck with me, is:

- Social media is for growth.
- Email is for profit.

## **Start before you’re ready**

Noah shares how he got fired from Facebook before it became the giant it is today.

He had a few failures before that too. But instead of waiting for the perfect idea or moment, he started building. Today, he’s launched more than seven successful businesses.

The message is clear: don’t wait for permission or the “right time.”

Just start.

## **Rejection is part of the process**

Entrepreneurship means asking.

It means asking for feedback, asking for sales and asking for help. Noah learned this from his dad, who sold copiers and wasn’t afraid of hearing “no.”

Rejection isn’t failure. It’s part of the journey. And sometimes, people do say yes.

One challenge from the book: walk into a cafe and ask for a 10% discount. Not because you need it, but to practice asking.

## **Ideas are everywhere**

What’s one of the most common reasons people give for not starting a business?

They say they don’t have a good idea. So they wait, hoping inspiration will strike someday.

But the thing is, you don’t need a genius idea.

You just need a real problem to solve. Noah suggests these ways to find business ideas:

- Solve your own frustrations
- Build accessories for popular products
- Explore marketplaces like Etsy or eBay
- Use Google autocomplete to see what people are struggling with

When reading this section, it reminded me of [The Lean Startup](https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Lean+Startup). Start with the customer, not the product.

## **A simple way to test your idea**

Instead of spending weeks on market research, Noah recommends a quick estimation:

- How many people might want this?
- What would you personally pay for it?
- What does it cost to make?

It’s a fast way to gauge whether your idea has potential (or not).

## **Real validation means real money**

After the quick-test you need real validation.

And the only true validation is when someone pays for your product. Not “I’d buy this,” but actual money transferred.

Your offer should include the product, the price, and maybe a comparison to help people understand it better.

If three people pay, you’re onto something. If they don’t, ask:

- What would make this a no-brainer?
- What would you pay?
- Do you know someone who’d want this?

## **Build an audience that buys**

Social media helps you grow an audience. But if you want to sell, email is where the magic happens.

Noah’s advice:

- Create a lead magnet (like a template, exclusive article, or mini-course)
- Send three automated emails:
    1. A welcome email with the question: *What do you want to hear from me?*
    2. A connection email (LinkedIn, etc.)
    3. An exclusive content email

Quality matters more than quantity. A small, engaged email list can outperform a massive social media following.

### **Marketing is about finding your people**

Good marketing starts with knowing where your ideal customer spends time. That could be Facebook groups, marketplaces, or influencer communities.

Set clear goals, experiment with different strategies, and track what works. There’s no one-size-fits-all approach.

When it comes to marketing, there is just trial, learning, and iteration.

### **Entrepreneurship is freedom**

The book ends with a reminder: entrepreneurship isn’t just about money.

It’s about freedom. The freedom to build, experiment, and choose your own path.

Profit matters, but so does enjoying the process.

## What I’m Taking Away

- Asking is free (and powerful).
- The customer comes first (not new, but worth to be highlighted once more).
- Ideas are everywhere. What matters is testing them quickly.
- Social media builds community. Email builds business.
- Weekly goals and accountability drive real progress.

If you’ve been sitting on an idea, *Million Dollar Weekend* might be the push you need.

It’s not about perfection.

It’s about momentum.
