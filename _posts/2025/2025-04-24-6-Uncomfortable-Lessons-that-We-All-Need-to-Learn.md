Recently I stumbled upon a [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/will-mctighe_10-phrases-that-kill-work-conversations-activity-7288193850886565890-TQAX?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAB-wogEBLw5G_rrS152qRlC-4ReULgayeSg) and decided to turn it into a short blog post:

1. Regret will haunt you more than failure. → Try it out and don’t shy away from it because you are afraid of failure!
2. You are always responsible for your emotional reactions. → You cannot change the cards life gives you, but you can change what you make from them!
3. Don’t feed your problems with thoughts, starve them with action. → Get active instead of overthinking.
4. Your life will be defined by your ability to handle uncertainty. → Nothing in life is certain: life is more like Poker than Chess.
5. If your goal is to have a healthier mind, start by removing all the junk from your diet. → You’ll become what you read.
6. Your “best life” won’t seek validation, but insecurity will. → You define what your “best life” truly is.
