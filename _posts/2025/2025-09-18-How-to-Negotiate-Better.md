I used to think negotiation was about compromise (as it’s taught in the. classic Getting to Yes). You know: meet in the middle, shake hands, move on. But then I read *Never Split the Difference* by Chris Voss, and it flipped that idea on its head.

Voss, a former FBI hostage negotiator, doesn’t deal in 50/50s. He deals in outcomes. And the tools he shares aren’t just for high-stakes standoffs. They’re surprisingly useful in everyday leadership, team dynamics, and even personal productivity.

Here are a few of the biggest lessons that stuck with me.

### **Ask calibrated questions**

Instead of yes/no questions, Voss recommends asking *calibrated questions.* These are open-ended prompts that start with **“How”** or **“What”**. These force the other person to think, reflect, and solve your problem for you.

For example:

- “How am I supposed to do that?”
- “What’s the biggest challenge you see here?”

It’s disarming.

It shifts the mental load.

And it keeps the conversation moving forward without much confrontation.

### **Your voice is a tool: use It**

Voss breaks down three voice tones:

1. **Late-night FM DJ**: calm, slow, reassuring. Use this most of the time.
2. **Playful/positive**: friendly, curious. Great for building rapport.
3. **Assertive/direct**: use sparingly, only when necessary.

I’ve started using the FM DJ voice in tense meetings. It’s amazing how much it de-escalates things.

### **Mirror. Label. Pause.**

One of the most powerful tools?

**Mirroring -** repeating the last few words the other person said, with a slight upward inflection. It sounds simple, but it builds connection fast.

Pair that with **labeling** (“It sounds like you’re feeling...”) and **strategic silence** (yes, count to four), and you’ve got a recipe for deepening trust and drawing out more information.

### **People want autonomy, give them “no”**

This one surprised me: letting someone say **“No”** actually makes them feel safe and in control. So instead of pushing for a “yes,” try reframing your ask:

- “Is now a bad time to talk?”
- “Would it be ridiculous to consider...?”

It’s counterintuitive, but it works.

### **Other tools to consider**

- **Accusation Audit**: Acknowledge the negatives *before* the other person brings them up. It diffuses tension.
- **Summarize, don’t just paraphrase**: Combine paraphrasing with emotional labeling to show deep understanding.
- **Deadlines & odd numbers**: Use specific, non-round numbers when making offers. They feel more thought-through.
- **Prospect Theory**: People fear losses more than they value gains. Frame your message accordingly.
- **Ask for help**: “How can I make this work for you?” is more powerful than it sounds.

### **Bonus Insight: spotting lies**

Voss also shares a fascinating tip: **liars tend to use more third-person pronouns** (“he,” “she,” “they”) and fewer “I” statements.

They’re distancing themselves from the lie.

It’s subtle, but once you know it, you start noticing it.
