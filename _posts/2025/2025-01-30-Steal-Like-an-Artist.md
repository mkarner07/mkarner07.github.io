These are some of the questions tackled by Austin Kleon in his books  [Steal Like an Artist](https://www.google.com/search?q=steal+like+an+artist), [Show Your Work](https://www.google.com/search?q=show+your+work), and [Keep Going](https://www.google.com/search?q=keep+going+by+austin+kleon). Each offers simple but powerful insights that can inspire anyone looking to unlock their creative potential.

I recently finished the trilogy and have learned a lot about creativity, ideation, and marketing

If you are interested, grab a cup of coffee: Here are some key takeaways from these books that might change how you think about creativity, sharing your work, and staying motivated.

## A quick summary for those in a hurry

Creativity isn’t something that hits like lightning to create something from scratch. Austin Kleon reframes creativity as remixing existing ideas with a touch of originality. And the special ingredient for being really creative? Boredom.

Boredom fosters creativity, while digital tools can stifle it by over-editing premature ideas.

While the first book in the trilogy is more about how to create something valuable, *Show Your Work* emphasizes sharing and storytelling - important skills when it comes to actually selling your ideas.

*Keep Going* finishes the trilogy with advice focusing on today, avoiding distractions, and preserving creative joy despite pressures from outside.

## 1. Steal Like an Artist

Don’t worry—this isn’t about theft.

Kleon redefines “stealing” as intentionally copying and remixing ideas to make something new. He challenges the idea of originality, suggesting that most new ideas are simply a combination of what already exists, with a pinch of innovation.

And what can truly spark creativity?

Boredom.

When we step away from constant digital distractions, our minds start to wander - and that’s where the best ideas are born. As our brains don’t like to be bored, they start thinking about something: processing the conversations we had, and problems we solved, …

And by processing and combining these impressions, new ideas can spark.

But don’t over-edit ideas too soon, as it’ll (1) stop your ideation mind and (2) won’t give your ideas enough time to grow. Let them simmer and don’t jump straight onto them with the convenience of modern tools.

## 2. Show Your Work

What good is creative work if no one knows it exists?

In this [Show Your Work](https://www.google.com/search?q=show+your+work), the author encourages readers to embrace social media as a platform to share their work, but with a twist: having your website is even better. It’s your corner of the internet where you have complete creative control. And it has never been easier to [create your website]({% post_url 2024-10-20-Create-and-Host-Your-Website-for-Free %}) as it is nowadays.

Work doesn’t sell itself.

You have to present it in a way that captures attention.

Storytelling becomes an essential skill, allowing you to “document your journey” and connect with others on a deeper level.

And here’s a tip: keep the momentum going. Creativity thrives when one project leads to another. Taking long breaks between projects might lead to a slump, but a planned pause, like a sabbatical, can be an incredible source of inspiration.

## 3. Keep Going

Creativity is never truly finished.

But it can be simply “abandoned” when we move on to the next thing.

Sustaining creative energy over a long time in the face of life’s challenges can be very hard. That’s what Austin Kleon focuses on in the final book of the trilogy.

What is the biggest threat to creativity?

Worrying about yesterday or fearing tomorrow.

Kleon’s advice: live for today, because it’s the only day you can control.

He also suggests breaking free from the grip of constant news and notifications. Start your mornings differently: perhaps with a quiet moment or a creative activity instead of scrolling through your phone.

Finally, while monetizing your work is often necessary, don’t let it drain all your joy.

Keep a piece of your creativity just for yourself. And when in doubt? Clean up your space. A tidy workspace often leads to a tidy mind.

## Takeaway: Creativity Is a Lifelong Journey

Kleon’s books remind us that creativity isn’t a one-time act.

It’s a habit, a mindset, and a journey. Whether you’re remixing ideas, sharing your work with the world, or finding ways to keep going through life’s ups and downs, these lessons are timeless.

So, the next time you feel stuck or uninspired, remember: to steal like an artist, show your work, and most importantly, keep going.
