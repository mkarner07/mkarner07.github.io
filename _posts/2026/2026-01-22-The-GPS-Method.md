Ever set a goal, big or small, only to watch it fade into the background of daily life?

You are not alone.

Most of us struggle not because our dreams are too ambitious, but because we lack a simple, reliable system to turn intention into action.

That is where the GPS Method comes in. This science-backed, easy-to-follow framework can help you achieve virtually any goal, from building a business to getting fit, or even finding the love of your life. The best part? It takes just 5 to 10 minutes to set up.

## Why many goals fail

Before diving into the method, let’s break it down simply: every goal is just a series of actions.

If you are not achieving your goals, it is because you are not doing the right things, or not doing them consistently. The GPS Method is designed to fix exactly that.

## What is GPS?

- Goal
- Plan
- System

Let’s break down each step.

## 1. Goal: get specific, get emotional, set boundaries

Most people make two big mistakes with goals:

- Vagueness. “I want to stop procrastinating” or “I want to start a business”. This is just not clear enough. What does “start a business” actually mean? How much revenue? What kind of business?
- Lack of Motivation. Goals set out of obligation, like “I should get fit,” rarely stick. You need a compelling, personal reason. You need to formulate your “why” (e.g. staying healthier longer to be present for your children).

Pro tip: Make your goal specific and measurable. For example, “Reduce my visceral fat by 50 percent in 12 months so I can be healthy for my family”.

Do not forget to note anti-goals.

What do you want to avoid while pursuing your goal? Maybe you want to build a business, but not at the cost of working weekends or sacrificing family time. Write them down.

## 2. Plan: bridge the gap between dream and reality

There is a classic debate. Are goals or systems more important?

The truth is, you need both, but the plan is the bridge.

- **Major moves**: Identify the three to five key actions that will get you to your goal. For fat loss, it might be 10.000 steps a day, 150 grams of protein, and three cardio sessions a week.
- **Reality check**: Is your plan actually likely to work? Would you follow it 100 percent? Think of those days where you are already struggling - would you still keep stick to your plan at low motivation? If your confidence is below 80 percent, rethink your plan.
- **Crystal ball method**: Imagine you did not reach your goal. What are the top three reasons why? Try to anticipate obstacles and plan how to overcome them.

## 3. System: make success inevitable

This is where most people fall short. You need a system to keep you on track.

- **Tracking**: Monitor your progress. People who track their actions, like daily steps or words written, are far more likely to succeed. For fitness these trackers can truly get you started on a journey to living more healthy.
- **Reminders**: Set up daily or weekly reminders: journals, calendar blocks, habit-tracking apps, or even a vision board.
- **Accountability**: Do not do it alone. Find an accountability buddy or use an app that checks in on your progress.

## Putting it all together

The GPS Method is not just about setting goals. It is about making them happen.

Spend 10 minutes defining your goal, plan, and system for anything you want to achieve. Then, revisit and adjust as you go.

Remember:

- Be **specific and emotionally invested** in your goal.
- Build a **realistic plan** and anticipate obstacles.
- Set up **systems for tracking**, reminders, and accountability.
