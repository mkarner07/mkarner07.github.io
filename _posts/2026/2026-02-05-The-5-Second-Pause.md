If you work in an office environment, chances are you spend a lot of time in meetings (unfortunately). In our fast-paced world, many professionals believe that quick responses signal competence.

**But does it really?**

A couple of weeks ago, I stumbled upon a simple yet powerful technique: **the 5-second pause**.

### **How does it work?**

Before you answer a question in a meeting, pause for **five seconds**.

That’s it.

- No rushing.
- No rambling.
- No filling the silence because it feels uncomfortable (and trust me, five seconds can feel long).

### **Why does it matter?**

This short pause does three powerful things:

1. **It shows you think before you speak:** Senior leaders instinctively take time before responding. That moment of silence signals thoughtfulness and confidence.
2. **It prevents oversharing:** Most people talk themselves out of clarity. Pausing helps you stay concise and avoid unnecessary details.
3. **It adds weight to your words:** Silence creates authority. When you speak after a pause, your words land with more impact.

Thank you for reading! I discovered this method through a [LinkedIn post by Pier Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/piermartin_heres-one-habit-that-made-me-instantly-sound-activity-7404159737182953472-9t_4?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAB-wogEBLw5G_rrS152qRlC-4ReULgayeSg) and found it immediately intriguing - so much so that I’ve already started using it in my own meetings.

**Your turn:** Give it a try (and let me know how it works for you on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthiaskarner/)).
