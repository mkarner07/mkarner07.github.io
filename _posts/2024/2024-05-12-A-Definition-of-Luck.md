How lucky are you?

Everybody has lucky moments, but can you influence your luck?

Yes, you can!

> Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity. – Seneca

In my opinion, this definition is extremely empowering: Luck is something you can actually influence (by preparing yourself).

Reading about success stories often makes us believe that they just got lucky. This is a self-protection mechanism: if we’d be so lucky, we’d also be so successful right?

But the thing is, most lucky people (let’s take lottery winners out of the equation) just were prepared once a big moment came. I really like the proverb: *“It takes months and years of preparation to become an overnight success.”*

How can you influence your own luck then?

- **Preparation**: Be curious and have an open mindset.
- **Opportunity**: Expose yourself to as many opportunities as possible. Build your network, go to events, and talk to people.
