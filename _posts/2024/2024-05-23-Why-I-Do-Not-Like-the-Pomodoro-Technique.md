As a confessed productivity enthusiast I’ve tried out many different productivity methods & techniques.

But there is one technique I am not very fond of: **the Pomodoro technique**.

### What is the Pomodoro technique?

It was developed in the 80s by Francesco Cirillo and is named after those kitchen alarms that look like a tomato (hence Pomodoro).

How does it work?

You work in short bursts (25 minutes) followed by short breaks (5 minutes). To keep track of time, an alarm is used.

The hypothesis is that the technique keeps your mind mobile.

### Why do I not like the technique?

Simply put: it contradicts a working style focused on deep work and flow.

In my opinion, deep work is the core element of being productive. If you come into flow: jackpot - effortless attention and peak productivity.

The prerequisite for deep work is working for more than one hour on one topic (e.g. Cal Newport recommends 90 minutes). Hence, working in short bursts like the Pomodoro technique suggests isn't feasible.
