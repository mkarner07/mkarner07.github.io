Breathing techniques are a powerful way to boost your alertness, increase focus, or support relaxation.

## Alertness

Techniques that create a surplus of oxygen increase prepare you for a strenuous activity.

### Wim Hof Method

This method was created by the Dutch Iceman [Wim Hof](https://www.wimhofmethod.com/). It increases your focus and helps you endure pain.

1. Inhale 4 seconds.
2. Exhale as fast as possible.

The method is discussed controversially as it is hyperventilation which numbs the brain a bit and produces noradrenalin (you can better endure pain).

### Fire Breath

This method can be helpful before you start with intense physical activity.

1. Inhale 4 seconds.
2. Exhale 2 seconds.

## Focus

Methods that help you focus have a balance between oxygen intake and outflow.

### Box Breathing

The Box Breathing has become popular as US Navy SEALs are using it to focus.

1. Inhale 4 seconds.
2. Hold your breath for 4 seconds.
3. Exhale 4 seconds.
4. Hold your breath for 4 seconds.

### Water Breath

This is a simplified version of Box Breathing with similar effects.

1. Inhale 4 seconds.
2. Exhale 4 seconds.

## Relaxation

Breathing techniques that help you relax are based on exhaling more than inhaling.

### 4-7-8 Technique

This technique is best for relaxation. It can be also helpful if you have trouble falling asleep.

1. Inhale 4 seconds
2. Hold your breath for 7 seconds.
3. Exhale 8 seconds

### Buteyko

This technique is also great for relaxation. It has the added benefit of making you more aware of your breathing in general.

Applying the method, your breathing should be nasal and as soft (silent) as possible. There are variants to this technique - the one I’ve picked up in a leadership seminar has the following pattern:

- Inhale 4 seconds. → Exhale 4 seconds.
- Inhale 4 seconds. → Exhale 5 seconds.
- Inhale 4 seconds. → Exhale 6 seconds.
- …
- Inhale k → Exhale k+1 seconds (continue as long as you can.)
