Digitalization and IT are similar but not the same as I’ve explored in one of my [recent articles]({% post_url 2024-04-11-What-role-does-IT-play-in-the-digital-transformation-of-our-world %}) where I’ve defined the tech trinity and analyzed their differences.

In this quick read, I'll break down the different skills you need for the three areas drawing from my experience as a Head of Digitalization, IT, and OT in my company.

## IT skills
- **Networking**: This is one of the core competencies everyone in IT needs. Without at least a rough knowledge of networking, you cannot understand how our interconnected world works.
- **IT security**: [Astra](https://www.getastra.com/blog/security-audit/how-many-cyber-attacks-per-day/#:~:text=from%20these%20threats.-,How%20Many%20Cyber%20Attacks%20Happen%20Per%20Day%20In%20The%20World,malware%20are%20detected%20every%20day.) says that 4,000 new cyber-attacks happen every day. And every 14 seconds, a new company gets hit by ransomware. These attacks cost billions. This is why IT security skills are so important.
- **Hardware and Software**: Similar to networking, understanding the fundamentals of hardware (e.g. how a PC works) and software is very important.
- **Programming**: Before I transitioned into IT, I thought that IT was a lot more about programming than it is. However, it is important (again) to at least know some basics.

## OT skills
- **Mechatronics**: Since OT deals with industrial equipment, and systems that affect physical things, knowing mechatronics is important for anyone in OT.
- **PLC programming**: This can be seen as a sub-skill within mechatronics. However, from my experience, this is the most crucial skill in OT as industrial equipment is controlled almost exclusively by PLCs.
- **Electrical engineering**: Every OT expert needs at least a basic understanding of electrical engineering.

## Digitalization skills
- **Change management**: This skill is almost as important as technical skills within the realm of digitalization.
- **Lean management**: If an inefficient process is done digitally, it's still not efficient. This is why applying [lean principles](https://medium.com/illumination/taking-it-further-5-additional-lean-approaches-for-personal-productivity-6ecda0dfb01e) first, is best practice.
- **Working ith Data**: To efficiently work with data, Data Engineering and Data Science are important skills within the realm of Digitalization.
