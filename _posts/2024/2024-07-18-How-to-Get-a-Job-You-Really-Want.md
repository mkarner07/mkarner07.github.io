How do you find or design your dream job?

There is the classic way: applying to dozens of job advertisements, hoping you get to the next stage and win them over in a personal interview.

But there is another way: According to the two Standford professors and bestselling authors Bill Burnett and Dave Evans the best way to get a job you really want is by "prototyping".

## How not to get a job

Searching for jobs online can be tough. In the US, only one in five jobs are advertised - all the others can only be found in a "hidden job market" and often these are the jobs that are the most exciting.

The situation in the USA is certainly more extreme than it is in Europe, but there is still some truth to it in Europe.

## How to get a job you want

### The classic way

When applying to job advertisements, you should adapt your resume and letter of motivation exactly to the job description - preferably even using the same wording.

This will help you fit in well and get to the next stage. If you don't have some of the skills listed, you should list similar skills that you do have. Once you have reached the next level, you can score points with your "true" talents.

### The new way

A new way of getting a job starts with “prototype interviews”. A prototype interview is when you chat with people already in your desired role.

It should not be a strictly formal interview (and certainly not a job interview). Instead, it should be an informal conversation over a coffee.

The aim is to get to know the other person's story and answer the following questions:

- What does the person like about their role?
- What does the person not like about their role?
- How did they get there?

Prototype interviews can often be a jumping-off point for job offers. By showing genuine interest in a job (and in the person you are talking to), the conversation may lead to a job offer.

Bill Burnett and Dave Evans share the story of one of their students who didn't get a single offer after 38 applications. Then he started prototype interviews. He had 56 interviews and got 7 job offers. He got all of them during the interviews.

Even if chances are good that you will get a job offer in a good prototype interview, this is not guaranteed. However, there is a trick to lead the conversation in the right direction:

> "The more I learn about company/department/… XYZ and the more people I meet here, the more fascinating it becomes. I wonder: what steps would be involved in exploring how someone like me could become a part of this organization." - Bill Burnett and Dave Evans
>

But let’s go back to the start: how do you get to a prototype interview with an interesting person?

You need to get to these people first.

The best way is if you are recommended by someone. Tap into your existing network and ask for support. And it is not that big of a deal - networking is not exploiting someone. It is more like asking for directions.

### Craft your dream job

It's not (only) about finding the job you like, but about making the best of the job you have at the moment.

This is the third possibility: job crafting. Job crafting is when you adapt your job within the job description so that it becomes meaningful to you.

This may sound difficult, especially if your job is already filled with many responsibilities and tasks that you are not in control of. However, there is some room in most jobs you can control and shape in a way that it becomes truly meaningful.

Think of it this way: when you're doing something you care about, you're more motivated and get more done. So, don't hesitate to talk to your manager about it. Chances are, you'll get to spend at least some time on tasks you truly enjoy.
