Managing time efficiently is key to personal productivity.

By aligning our activities with our energy levels, we can achieve more and stay motivated longer. I discovered this during a low-motivation week this year and found a great method to overcome my productivity low: drafting my ideal week.

## What is an Ideal Week?

An ideal week is one where you look back and say, "This week was awesome!”

It's not about unlimited money or free time but about feeling accomplished and energized.

Everyone’s ideal week will vary, but it typically includes categories like sleep, work, commuting, eating, and hygiene.

**Timeboxing: The Key Tool**

Timeboxing involves allocating fixed periods to specific tasks. It helps create urgency, prioritize tasks, and separate planning from execution.

However, it’s important not to over-plan—leave some flexibility to handle unexpected changes.

**Crafting Your Ideal Week**

1. **List Activities:** Start by listing everything you want in your ideal week, such as sleep, work, commuting, cooking, and family time.
2. **Categorize Activities:** Group activities into categories like health, love, work, and play.
3. **Allocate Time:** With 168 hours in a week, start by assigning time to the most time-consuming activities, like sleep and work. Include some “unplanned time” as well!
4. **Use a Calendar:** Plan your activities in a calendar, preferably in 30-minute blocks for a balanced overview.

### Crafting Your Ideal Work Week

This depends on your job type:

- **Little Creative Freedom:** Treat work as a fixed block.
- **Creative Freedom (e.g., managers):** Block time for deep work and minimize meetings.
- **Self-Employed:** Plan work freely but strategically.

## Applying Your Ideal Week

Keep your plan simple with no more than 12 activities. Block time for deep work when your energy is highest and leave unplanned time for flexibility.

Remember, the ideal week is a guide to boost productivity, not a rigid schedule. Adjust as needed to stay effective and motivated.
