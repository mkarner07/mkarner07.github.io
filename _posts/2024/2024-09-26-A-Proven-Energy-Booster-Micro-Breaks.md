Productivity is a matter of optimizing energy, not just time.

Productivity is a matter of optimizing energy, not just time.

Micro-breaks can be a great strategy.

To me, micro-breaks don't mean that you need to take a break every hour (this might even interrupt your focus).

I think of micro breaks to handle breaks during the day.

When I'm busy, I skip breaks altogether because there's so much to do and so little time. On such days, taking a 30-minute break feels impossible.

There micro-breaks come into play.

Taking a short break (like 5 minutes) gives you much energy and can make you more productive overall. It helps you to maintain your cognitive, emotional, and even physical capacity.

As micro-stress can accumulate at work and burn you out, micro-breaks can build you back up.
