## Empathy

The key to team spirit is mutual empathy and trust. When these are present, team members support each other, leading to extraordinary results.

You as a manager, however, must start:

- Trust employees
- Show empathy
- Meet at eye-level

## Self-determination

When employees feel in control of their tasks, their job satisfaction goes up and stress goes down. Allowing your team, the freedom to prioritize and make decisions themselves can be tough, especially if you're new to leadership.

However, when you stop micromanaging and let your team shine, everyone thrives!

## Create a safe environment

If employees feel psychologically safe, they are more motivated and also perform better. Your job as a leader, above everything else, should be to create a safe environment for your employees.

This also means occasionally you need to break (pointless) rules!

The next step is to create a culture of collaboration: People work better in teams and it's up to leadership to create a culture where employees enjoy working together. If your team starts to improvise: jackpot, you are on the right track

## Make decisions not just based on numbers

Don’t get me wrong: numbers are crucial when making decisions. However, you shouldn’t also listen to different opinions and make choices that benefit the whole team.

This is a component of building a safe working environment.

## Take time

Building good relationships takes time. They aren't built through a few minutes of small talk once a week at the coffee machine.

As a leader, your main task is to be there for your team. Help them solve their problems (don’t solve them) by removing obstacles in their way.

## Be integer

To earn and keep your team’s trust, it's important to stick to your decisions and values, even when it's not beneficial or might put you at a disadvantage.
