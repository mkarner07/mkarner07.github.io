## 1. The Big Picture

In my early years leading digital transformation of my company, I concentrated on solving specific issues with my team.

But I've realized the value of seeing the big picture.

With that I mean focusing on developing solutions that fit together instead of solving problems on their “own islands”. Therefore a digital architecture is needed that is closely linked with a company's IT structure.

## 2. Change Management

Digital technologies hold immense potential, but their value lies in their actual usage.

Many advanced solutions remain unused because they fail to benefit end-users.

To drive adoption, involve users early, address their needs, and start with a minimum viable product. This approach facilitates successful digital transformation.

## 3. Stability Wins vs Complexity

Digitalization can be dangerous if it involves established processes.

Stability in existing processes is crucial.

Simplifying solutions, focusing on core issues, and allowing user flexibility yield benefits: robustness, core development time, and user acceptance.

## 4. Skillset in Digital Transformation

As a Digital Transformation Manager, developing cutting-edge solutions is one aspect. Equally important are …

- **Change Management**,
- **Project Management**,
- **Marketing** to showcase value, and
- **Operations** to ensure robustness and quick recovery from failures.

## 5. Operating Digital Solutions

If you don't plan how to keep a solution running smoothly from the beginning, it might not last long after it's made.

So, it's better to think about how to operate it early on. This way, you won't use up all your resources later fixing problems. Instead, you'll have more time to work on exciting new projects.
