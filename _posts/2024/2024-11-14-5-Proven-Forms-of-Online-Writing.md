Writing online can take different forms.

According to [Nicolas Cole](https://medium.com/@nicolascole77), a very successful online writer, there are 5 proven forms of online writing:

1. **Actionable Guide**: These are instructions (formerly How-Tos). The goal is for the reader to bookmark the article and come back to the article every once in a while.
2. **Own opinion**: This is among the largest categories of online articles. It is a very competitive field.
3. **Curated list**: Lists seem uncreative at first. However, when implemented correctly, they are an excellent way of providing readers with information quickly.
4. **Story**: Telling a story is not limited to fiction alone!
5. **Credible "talking head"**: This is not about a single article. It is more about being seen as a credible resource for the reader (*This article was written by someone who has experience and knowledge of the topic*).
