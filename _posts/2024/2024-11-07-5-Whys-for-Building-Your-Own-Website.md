How many people have a personal website?

According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/learnvest/2014/06/17/do-job-candidates-with-personal-websites-have-an-edge/), 7 % of the general population (or 15 % of millennials) have a personal website.

I’d have guessed more people would have a personal website as it never has been easier to create your website as it is today.

Some website-builders are as easy to use as standard office software (or even easier), WordPress hosting services, and solutions completely for free such as GitHub pages.

Why do so few people have their websites then?

I don’t know, but in this article, I’ll give you five Reasons why you should consider creating a personal website.

## Why No. 1: Put yourself out there

This is the simplest why: with a personal website you can put yourself out there. This can have different reasons itself, like:

- Find a new job
- Build your brand
- Show off your work

With your personal website, you can show the world who you are and why the world should know about you!

But you could also do this on social media, right? This is where Why No. 2 comes in.

## Why No. 2: Publish whatever you want when you want

The only limiting factor is your imagination.

On your website, you can publish whatever content you want whenever you want. You don’t have to obey rules or wait for a publisher to publish your blog post.

And additionally: you own it. You don’t have to give up any rights. The content remains yours.

## Why No. 3: Learn something new

Building a website isn’t difficult.

But you’ll learn something valuable when you create and host your website.

### Create a website

Every business nowadays (no matter the size) needs some web presence so taking the time to build your website builds this skill.

And don’t be intimidated: There are tons of guides out there on how to do it (if you want to build and host your website for free, check out this [one]({% post_url 2024-10-20-Create-and-Host-Your-Website-for-Free %})).

### Create traffic to your website.

If you want people to actually visit your website, you cannot count on them finding it in a web of billions of websites out there. You need to bring people to your website.

This means that you have to market your website somehow (via social media, …). And, marketing is also a skill that is worth learning!

## Why No. 4: **Develop your career**

The core of a personal website is you. This is why it is called a “personal website” It gives you the chance to present yourself to the world: What are you good at? Why should people know about you? How do you create value?

It can be your web-based Curriculum Vitae and benefit your career. And this is not only true if you are working in tech. Think of what recruiters usually do first after they’ve read someone’s CV: they’ll google the person. And if they do, why not impress them with your website?

## Why No. 5: Start a business

You can use your website in a different direction though: it can be a jump-off spot for a new business.

As I’ve written in No. 3: every business nowadays needs a web presence. A personal website gives you the opportunity to learn how to create and manage a website.

You can build your brand, sell something on your website, or promote your services.
