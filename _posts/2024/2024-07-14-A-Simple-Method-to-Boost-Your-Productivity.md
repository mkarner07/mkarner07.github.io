One of the simplest ones is to ask yourself a single question:

**“How would this look like if it were any fun?”**

Why is this powerful?

How we feel about the things we are doing depends a lot on our mindset and how we approach certain things. If we start something thinking it won't be fun, it often ends up being exactly that - boring and not fun.

But if we ask ourselves how we could make a rather boring task fun we start with a positive mindset and often making something more fun can be as simple as e.g. turning on some music, making a game out of it, or doing it together with others.
