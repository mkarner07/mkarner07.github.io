How can you slow down time?

Some might say that doing something boring makes time slow down.

But does it really?

Sure, at the moment, those dull minutes feel like they’re dragging on forever. But when you look back later, those hours of boredom shrink considerably.

Luckily, the opposite happens with fun and engaging activities.

Take holidays, for example: at the moment, time seems to fly by because you’re so immersed. But when you look back, it feels like they lasted longer than they actually did, thanks to all the great memories you’ve made.

This is the Holiday Paradox.

## How does it come to be?

The Holiday Paradox is caused by the difference between (1) *in-the-moment time perception* and (2) *remembered time perception*.

1. When you're immersed in an engaging or enjoyable activity, time seems to fly by. On the other hand, boring or repetitive activities slow down the perceived time.
2. In boring activities, we are mentally not very engaged. Hence, little new memories are created. Our perception of time heavily depends on the memories we create. During engaging activities (like holidays), we make dozens of new memories, which prolongs the perceived time in hindsight.

## How can you make time slow down?

To expand your sense of time, you can deploy the following strategies:

1. **Novelty**: Incorporating new and varied experiences - like taking different routes, trying new activities, or learning new skills - helps break routines and creates new memories.
2. **Reflection**: Journaling, photography, and reflecting on meaningful moments through techniques like "[Homework for Life](https://aliabdaal.com/newsletter/homework-for-life/)" ensure that you remember experiences and even enrich them in hindsight.
3. **Mindfulness**: Practicing meditation, focusing fully on the present, or engaging in activities like yoga increases awareness and memory formation, making time feel slower day-to-day.
