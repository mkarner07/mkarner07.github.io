We want to feel happy.

We pursue it. The pursuit of Happiness is even part of the US Declaration of Independence.

But what does happiness actually mean?

Most definitions try to describe happiness as a combination of positive feelings such as contentment, joy satisfaction, and overall well-being. But these feelings are also hard to describe: when do you feel satisfied?

Recently I stumbled upon a different type of definition.

> *Happiness means not suffering. - Naval Ravikant*

To me, this seems more precise than a combination of other feelings. Weâ€™d be happy if there would be no suffering. But what does suffering mean? It is the state when you leave out the sense of "something is missing in my life".
