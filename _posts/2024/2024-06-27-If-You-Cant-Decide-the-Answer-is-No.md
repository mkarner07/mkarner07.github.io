According to [Harvard Business Review](https://www.notion.so/Ideen-f-r-Blogposts-91e9ca50576942a0921abf2dcb06071f?pvs=21), we make about 35,000 decisions per day, and with every decision you are slowly depleting your decision reservoir.

Many of these decisions are offers or asking you for commitment: do you want to participate in a workshop, take part in a free course, hear a sales pitch for a certain product, …

Saying yes to all these offers is simply impossible.

A day only has 24 hours.

But saying no can be difficult - especially if you are a diplomatic person like me. I’ve struggled with saying no to such offers, but I’ve found a simple but powerful solution:

If you can’t decide, the answer is no. I have also heard the version *“Hell yeah, or no”*.

With this strategy, you can reduce your decision-load and not overcommit yourself to a ton of meetings you’d rather drop once the due date comes near.
