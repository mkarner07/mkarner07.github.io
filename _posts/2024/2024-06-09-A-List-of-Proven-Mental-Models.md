This year, I've learned a lot about mental models and systems. Using these tools can really boost your productivity.

In this short post, I want to summarize a few key mental models:

- **The principal-agent problem**: A model about conflicting interests between different parties in decision-making processes.
- **Compound interest**: Exponentially growing interest.
- **Pareto principle (80/20 Rule)**: Most effects come from a minority of causes.
- **Mathematics**: number lines, algebraic equations, geometric shapes, probability trees, graphs, and charts, …
- **Black swans**: Unpredictable events with significant impact.
- **Dunning-Kruger effect**: Overestimating one's abilities due to lack of expertise.
- **Network effect**: The value of a product increases as more people use it.
- **Falsifiability**: Testability of hypotheses through potential contradiction or disproof.
- **Confirmation bias**: Tendency to favor information that confirms existing beliefs.
- **Running uphill**: Focusing on being positive, calm, and purposeful.
- **Regression to the mean**: High or low performance tends to move towards the average over time.

*This list could be continued much more, but my goal with this post was to keep the main part below 150 words for a specific Medium publication. However, I might continue the list in a future post.*
