I mean yes, some meetings are really important for us to …

- share ideas
- move things forward, or
- come together and create momentum in a project.

But, meetings can be a big waste of time.

Since I started [working in the corporate world]({% post_url 2023-11-30-My-Transformative-Journey-into-Corporate-Culture %}), I've had many meetings - some good ones and some bad ones. The good ones share this 4 core-rules:

- Keep meetings as short as possible (15-30 minutes are optimal)
- Preparation is key for an efficient meeting: if you're leading it, send out materials beforehand and if you're attending, jot down three things you want to address.
- The most important section of a meeting is the "next steps" section. Assign clear tasks and deadlines.
- Avoid discussing [anchor problems]({% post_url 2024-01-18-Anchor-Problems-How-to-Overcome-Huge-Challenges %}) and don’t discuss gravity problems at all.
