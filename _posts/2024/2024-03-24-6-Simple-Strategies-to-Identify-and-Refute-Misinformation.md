In today's world, it's hard to escape the term "fake news." It became even more common during and after the election of Donald Trump, who often labeled news as fake, even if it was true.

With the rise of powerful generative AI and deep fakes, it's becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish fact from fiction.

So, how can we navigate this landscape of misinformation?

Let's break it down.

## Types of Bullshit

### Numbers and statistics

Numbers are often used to back up statements, but they can be misleading.

Misused statistics or mathiness, where fake formulas are used, can make something seem more credible than it actually is.

Similar to that, errors in data selection, like selection bias, can skew our perception as well.

### Bullshit in Visualizations

Visualizations can help us understand data better, but they can also be misleading. Misused charts, like 3D charts or distorted axes, can distort the message. It's important to be critical when interpreting visual data.

## Identifying and Calling Bullshit

There are some simple strategies you can use to identify and refute bullshit.

1. If something sounds too good (or too bad) to be true, it most likely is.
2. Check the credibility of the source.
3. Refute bullshit by applying reductio ad absurdum.
4. Provide counter-evidence or show an analogy.
5. Re-visualize data.
6. Use the Fermi Approximation or create a Null Model (a very simple model that can be done without data).

If you are calling bullshit on something, ensure to not personally attack someone (you cannot convince somebody in being wrong if they feel attacked). Instead, try to find common ground.

## Conclusion

Fake news and misinformation are everywhere, but with critical thinking and vigilance, we can avoid falling for them.

By questioning sources, analyzing data, and using logical reasoning, we can navigate the digital landscape with confidence.

Keep honing your critical thinking skills, and don't let fake news fool you.
