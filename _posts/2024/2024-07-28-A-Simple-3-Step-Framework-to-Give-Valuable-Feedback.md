Recently I’ve learned about the PPI-Framework. PPI stands for "**P**urpose of feedback", "**P**erceived behavior" and "**I**mpact".

It is a simple but powerful framework for how to structure a feedback session.

## P - purpose of feedback

Start by outlining the purpose of your feedback.

This sets the stage and helps the recipient understand why you are having this conversation. By explaining the reason behind the feedback, you ensure that it’s seen as a valuable opportunity for growth rather than pure criticism.

## P - perceived behavior

It’s crucial to focus on concrete actions and facts rather than a subjective interpretation.

This clarity prevents misunderstandings and ensures the other person knows what actions are being discussed. A behavior can be …

- Following/not following
- Work performance
- Missing a deadline

## I - Impact

Finally, explain the impact of the behavior on the team, project, or organization.

This helps the recipient understand the consequences of their actions, both positive and negative. By illustrating how their behavior affects others and the overall goals, you make the feedback more compelling and relevant.

Understanding the impact encourages your team member to reflect on their actions and motivates them to make necessary adjustments.

## What else to consider?

### Mindset

Try to stay positive, even if it is critical feedback you have to deliver. And don’t just focus on critical feedback - give positive feedback too!

### Mood

Feedback is valuable, however, it is important to be in the right mood when you are doing a feedback session. Never provide feedback when you feel …

- Tired
- Angry
- Hungry
