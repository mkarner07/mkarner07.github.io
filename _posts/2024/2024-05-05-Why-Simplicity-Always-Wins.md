We live in a complex world.

And I think this is a good thing! There are tons of information created and connected each day (according to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/05/21/how-much-data-do-we-create-every-day-the-mind-blowing-stats-everyone-should-read/), 2.5 quintillion bytes of data). This is why humankind is evolving at a faster and faster pace.

*But if the world around us is so complex, why not embrace simplicity?*

When creating a solution for something (in my niche these are digital solutions and software) the environmental conditions are already very complex.

It is tempting to include novel frameworks and new research results into our solutions to make them stand out (I am guilty of doing this myself after finishing my PhD). However, this leads to the solutions becoming very complex. Hence, the maintainability suffers, and optimizations down the road become increasingly difficult.

When developing something, embrace simplicity. Cut out the fluff and bullshit and keep it to the essentials because **simplicity always wins**.
