Our world sometimes seems to be obsessed with talent.

The thing is we don’t just see talent. What we see is achievement and there is more to achievement than just talent:

- achievement = skill *×* effort
- skill = talent *×* effort
- achievement = talent *×* effort²

This definition is from [Grit]({% post_url 2024-02-11-The-Power-of-Persistence %}). In [So Good They Can’t Ignore You]({% post_url 2024-04-07-Why-following-your-passion-might-not-be-the-best-career-choice %}), Cal Newport draws similar conclusions and there are even more authors and scientists underlining the fact that effort trumps talent ([Desinging Your Life]({% post_url 2024-04-25-Design-a-Life-You-Love %}), Can’t Hurt Me, …).

But if you are putting a lot of effort into improving your skills, you should practice deliberately.

## What is deliberate practice?

Deliberate practice means learning by tackling challenges slightly above your current skill level.

It was originally researched by [Anders Ericsson](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1993-40718-001) and is one reason why experts achieve such a high level of ability.

## The 5 Principles of Deliberate Practice

### (1) Decide which Market you are in

According to Cal Newport, there are two different types of “skill markets”:

- **Winner takes it all (WTA)**: Environments, where just one single skill matters (e.g., musician, writer, artist, …)
- **Auction**: Multiple different skills are needed to succeed.

### (2) Capital type

If you are in a WTA market, there is a single skill you should focus on. If you are in a different environment, it is wise to split your attention into different skills to create a unique skill portfolio.

### (3) Define what is good

Set smart goals.

### (4) Stretch and destroy

This is the actual deliberate practice.

Sit down (or stand up) and start practicing. Deliberate practice isn’t fun. But it helps you develop valuable skills most efficiently.

### (5) Be patient

Malcolm Gladwell popularized the 10,000-hour rule - it takes that much time of deliberate practice to become an expert level.

So be patient - deliberate practice isn’t easy, but it pays off!
