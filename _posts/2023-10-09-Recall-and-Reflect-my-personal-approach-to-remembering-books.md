Reading is fun. You can dive into the minds of great scientists, explore the thoughts of creative minds and learn new things. Reading a non-fiction book is like installing a new operating system on your PC: it changes the way you process information and how you think of certain topics. But there is a catch: in order to benefit from the books you read, you have to remember the core principles and ideas.

Remembering what I read was difficult for me in the past. However, I found a way to remember what I read: In this article I want to share it with you!

## Why your reading-mindset is important.
When diving into non-fiction, don't be a passive observer; be an active explorer of knowledge. To make your reading truly memorable, start by asking a simple yet potent question: What's worth remembering? Trust me, this mindset shift can be a game-changer.

As I venture through the pages of non-fiction, I constantly interrogate myself. Is this idea fresh or familiar? How can I apply it to my life? What are the key takeaways that deserve a spot in my memory? When I encounter a profound passage, I jot down my insights, even if it means pausing mid-read. And after I finish, a quick recap and a concise summary in my trusty note-taking app seal the deal.

In the world of learning, it's all about active engagement and strategic retention. So, the next time you pick up a non-fiction treasure, ask yourself: What's worth engraving in my memory? Your brain will thank you.

## How I take notes while reading: my method.

### Before the First Page: Your Reading Primer
It is important to create a place where the notes will live. You can use pencil and paper, or one of the many exisiting notetaking apps out there (Evernote, Notion, Obidian, Onenote, …). Each of the tools have there pros and cons and suit different styles of note-takers. Whichever style you choose, I suggest that you use at least a minimal structure:
- **Short summary**: This will be filled out once you read the whole book.
- **Summary**: This section should contain your main notes you take during reading. Before starting to read write briefly down the table of content. This will help you structuring your notes even better.
- **Learnings**: Everytime you want to remember something, or have an idea, the particular notes come here.

### Reading Smart: During and After Your Reading Session

Let's dive into a crucial aspect of each efficient reading session: breaking it down into two key phases - before and after.

**(i) The Power of Reading Mindfully**: When you're in the midst of a captivating reading session, here's a golden rule: always aim to complete a logical block. Why, you ask? Well, by doing so, you keep all those juicy insights neatly bundled together for easy access later. But what happens when you stumble upon a game-changing discovery, a life-altering nugget of wisdom? Two options: (i) mark it for quick reference, or (ii) set the book or article aside for a moment and jot down those fresh, buzzing ideas. Trust me, it's worth the pause!

**(ii) The Post-Reading Recap: Seal the Deal**: After you've wrapped up your reading adventure, don't rush to the next task. Take a few precious minutes to reflect. Start by summarizing the logical block you just conquered and slot that note into your organized structure. But here's the real magic: dig deep and extract your personal learnings. What does that mean? Well, it could be the methods you're itching to apply in your life, the mind-blowing facts you've just absorbed, or even the brilliant ideas sparked by that particular block. Don't let these treasures slip through your fingers; jot them down!

### Beyond the Last Page: After You Finish a Book

Once you've turned that final page of a book or reached the end of a lengthy article, the adventure is not over yet. In fact, this is where the real magic happens - it's time to supercharge your learning.

**1. Reconnect with Your Notes**

First up, revisit those precious notes you took while immersed in your reading journey. Read your notes and read all the learings you wrote down Let's make sure those gems are fresh in your mind.

Ask yourself: "Are there additional insights I should add?" If the answer is yes, don't hesitate to curate and expand your notes. Your notes are a dynamic canvas, ready to capture every spark of knowledge.

**2. Craft a Personal Summary**

But here's the real game-changer: create a concise, 3 to 5 sentence short summary of the book. This isn't your typical summary; it's a personalized key to unlocking the learnings tucked within those pages.

This summary isn't meant for others; it's your shortcut to reload those valuable insights into your working memory. It's your secret sauce to retaining what you've learned.

**3. Embrace the Challenge**

Now, let's address the elephant in the room - crafting that short summary can be a daunting task, especially after a book brimming with insights. But fear not, there are some guiding questions to ease the process:
- What are the main ideas that resonated with you?
- If you could implement just one idea from this book right now, which one would it be?
- Imagine explaining the book to a friend - what key points would you highlight?

I'll let you in on a little secret – writing these short summaries has been a game-changer for me in retaining what I read. When I revisit my book notes, I often find myself gravitating towards that concise summary, and voila, it helps me reload (most of) those insights back into my working memory.

So there you have it, my fellow readers. Let's transform the way we remember what we read, one page at a time!
