## Hi, I'm Matthias!

Great that you are here!

I’ve always been an avid reader, and my reading preferences have evolved over the years. In my childhood, I delved into novels, during my student years, it was textbooks, and as a doctoral student, I immersed myself in scientific articles. Throughout my academic journey, I developed a deep appreciation for well-researched scientific papers and even had the privilege of contributing to this body of work by publishing several articles as part of my dissertation.

My career path has predominantly been in application-oriented science, which led me to work on industry projects and apply my research findings in practical settings. Consequently, I made the transition from academic research to the corporate world.

Today, I serve as the manager of a department dedicated to digitalization and IT within an international corporation. While my career has taken me in exciting directions, my passion for reading has remained constant. However, due to the demands of my career change, my writing output has declined in the recent years.

With creating this website, I aim to change that narrative.

I’m excited to share insights I collected from my personal experiences and explore a range of topics, including personal productivity, management and leadership as well as digital transformation.

Thank you for dropping by!
