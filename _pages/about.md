Hi there, great that you are here!

My name is, you guessed right, Matthias Karner. Professionally, I am leading a department dedicated to Digitalization & IT.

### Why did I create this website?
I've always been an avid reader. In my childhood, I delved into novels, during my student years, it was textbooks, and as a doctoral student, I was reading tons of scientific articles. I even had the privilege of contributing to this body of research by publishing several articles as part of my dissertation (cf. [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Matthias-Karner-3)). For the last couple of years I have been reading a lot of [non-fiction books]({% post_url 2023-11-19-Learning-Journey-my-top-33-non-fiction-bookshelf %}).

But I also regularly listen to podcasts and audibooks and read online.

I recently signed up on [Medium](https://matthiaskarner.medium.com/) to have access to one of the best repositories of online articles. My expectations were exceeded: There are so many exciting, educational and humorous posts on the platform!

It was encouraging to see all this great articles. I wanted to contribute too, so I decided to share the insights I picked up so far: on Medium and on my personal website.

### How did I collect these insights?

I did my Bachelor and Master in Industrial & Mechanical Engineering at the Vienna University of Technology. 

My professional carreer started in application-oriented science at the Fraunhofer institute (parallel to my PhD), where I worked on research projects - most of them in cooperation with industrial partners. The topics were mostly in the realm of Industrial Engineering: lean manufacturing, digitalization, maintenance management, product development, cyber-physical-systems and production planning.

During my PhD my interests shifted more and more in the direction of Digitalization and IT: I learned programming (not just theoretically) and delved into methods such as machine learing, meta-heuristics, predictive maintenance, automation, … Luckily, I was able to apply what I learned in the research projects I did.

After finishing my PhD I made the transition to the corporate world and took the job of a "Digital Transformation Manager". I got the chance to build up a team to accelarete the digital transformation of my company. Things worked out pretty well and my team quickly grew.
For more than two years now, I am responsible for IT systems, digitalization, automation and data science in an international cooperation.

### And what now?
I am already thrilled what the future holds up for me. But one thing is certain: I will continue to be curious, read & learn and share the insights I'll stumble upon.
