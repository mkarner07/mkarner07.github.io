Have you ever made a lazy choice late in the day - ordering takeout (again), skipping the gym, or sending a curt reply you later regret?

You're not alone.

Your brain, like your body, gets tired. And when it comes to making decisions, fatigue can sneak in quietly but have serious consequences.

A fascinating study from 2011 illustrates this perfectly. Researchers followed a group of judges reviewing parole requests. You’d think things like the severity of the crime, behavior in prison, or time served would be the deciding factors. But something else had a surprisingly strong influence: **the time of day**

Prisoners whose cases were heard in the **morning** were far more likely to be granted parole than those seen in the **afternoon -** even when their situations were practically identical.

The reason?

**Decision fatigue**.

## What is Decision Fatigue?

Decision fatigue is a mental exhaustion after you’ve made too many choices. Like a muscle that's been overused, your brain starts to default to the easiest, safest option. This often means doing nothing or sticking with the status quo.

For those judges, that “safe” option was to deny parole.

But this isn’t just about courtrooms and criminal justice.

Decision fatigue impacts **all of us**, every day. From what to eat for lunch to whether to speak up in a meeting, every decision chips away at your mental energy.

Eventually, your brain starts looking for shortcuts. Sometimes that means avoiding a decision altogether. Other times, it means making a poor one.

## How decision fatigue shows up in your life

You probably don’t spend your days ruling on parole cases, but you still make hundreds of decisions: what to wear, how to respond to emails, and which tasks to prioritize. On their own, many of these seem small, but together, they add up.

Here’s the catch: **not all decisions are created equal**.

- Choosing what to eat for breakfast? Easy. It’s familiar, low-stakes, and quick.
- Replacing a broken car? Hard. It’s unexpected, expensive, and involves research, risk, and stress.

The bigger, newer, and more urgent a decision is, the faster it drains your mental battery.

So if you’ve made one major decision already (like picking a school for your child) you might find yourself oddly indecisive about what to cook that night.

That’s not laziness.

That’s decision fatigue.

## How to protect yourself from it

The good news?

While we can't escape making decisions, **we can get smarter about how and when we make them**. Here are some practical ways to stay sharp:

### 1. **Reduce the number of daily decisions**

Simplify where you can:

- Plan meals ahead of time.
- Stick to a morning routine.
- Automate low-stakes choices like what to wear (Steve Jobs famously wore the same outfit daily for this reason).

### 2. **Tackle big decisions early**

Your brain is freshest in the morning. Reserve the first part of your day for your most important decisions.

### 3. **Break big decisions into steps**

Instead of making one huge decision all at once, break it down.

For example, if you're buying a car, spend one day researching models, another comparing prices, and third visiting dealerships. This spreads out the cognitive load.

### 4. **Take decision breaks**

Just like your body needs rest, so does your brain.

Step away from your desk.

Go for a walk.

Give yourself space to recharge before diving into another tough choice.

### 5. **Imagine you’re advising a friend**

It’s often easier to give someone else advice than to decide for yourself. So mentally step outside the problem. What would you tell a friend in the same situation?

If you can pull it off (without getting the feeling of tricking yourself), it helps create emotional distance and clearer thinking.

### 6. **Learn to let go of the small stuff**

Not every choice deserves your full attention. Save your energy for the decisions that really matter and let the rest go.

## Final Thoughts

We like to think we’re rational beings, carefully weighing every option. But in reality, our energy is limited, and our decision-making ability fades throughout the day.

The key to great leadership, strong productivity, and a calmer personal life isn't making more decisions. **It’s making better ones**. And that starts with recognizing your limits, designing your day accordingly, and learning when to pause.

Because sometimes, the best decision isn’t a decision at all. It’s knowing when your brain needs a break.

**Now it’s your move:** What’s one small decision you can automate or delegate this week to save your mental energy for what truly matters?
