Why do we work?

Is it just for the money? Do we want to do something that we enjoy or something that contributes to society?

According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidmichels/2022/09/15/why-do-we-work/), there are different reasons why we work, but there is one common thing: meaning. Some people work just to earn money and find meaning in private, while others find meaning directly in the work they do.

In the past years, I’ve read many books on personal development and there seems to be a common suggestion: **work for learning and not for money**.

I mean of course, we still need to make ends meet, but at a certain point, it is better to turn down a promotion (cf. So Good Thy Can’t Ignore You, Grit, …) and stay in a position where we can learn more.

It will certainly pay off in the long run with more job fulfillment and better pay!
