Since October 2023 I’ve been publishing two articles per week consistently: one article on Thursdays and another one on Sundays. Until now, I’ve written more than 100 articles and I’ve to admit:

The first few articles didn’t come easy.

Per article I had to invest multiple hours to end up an article I’d be willing to publish.

Fortunately, that changed, and after about 30 articles, [writing became a habit]({% post_url 2024-10-13-The-6-Stages-of-Online-Writing %}) for me. I started to really enjoy the process, and I also got faster at writing and editing.

Writing has become a habit, and I won’t give up anytime soon.

However, consistently publishing twice a week has become a big commitment to me. Working full-time, commuting a long distance, and caring for my family already fill up my days quite extensively.

The last couple of weeks have been quite intense. There were a lot of things going on and it was hard to allocate enough time to write two articles in good quality. Thanks to my article backlog I was able to maintain my pace.

But, my article backlog is now running dry and there are still some more intense months to come. As I don’t want to endanger the positive feeling I have when it comes to writing, I don’t want to over-commit, burn out and stop writing altogether.

Therefore, I decided to change my article pace: I’ll transition to publishing once per week and I’ll start with it next Sunday.

Dear readers, I hope you’ll understand as I shift to publishing a bit less frequently, but rest assured, I’m not stopping! Your support means the world to me. Thank you for being here!

See you around!

All the best, Matthias
