When you hear the word "power," what comes to mind?

Many people think of control, authority, or even fear. But power doesn’t have to be about dominance - it can be about inspiration, influence, and creating something meaningful.

This is what is called *good power*.

Ginni Rometty, former CEO of IBM, explains that good power is not about enforcing obedience.

It’s about inspiring belief, so people want to follow - not because they have to, but because they choose to. It’s about making people feel valued, heard, and motivated. And one of the most important lessons in leadership is that great things can be accomplished in a *positive* way.

True leadership comes from fostering a culture where individuals feel empowered to take ownership of their contributions.

When people are encouraged to bring their ideas and perspectives to the table, they not only invest themselves more deeply in the outcome but also inspire those around them.

## Use good power to inspire

At its core, leadership is about inspiring belief in others.

When people believe in something, they bring all their energy, creativity, and passion to it. That’s what true power looks like - the kind that builds, rather than breaks.

1. **Co-Create the Future**: Instead of dictating, bring people into the process. When people help shape a vision, they are far more invested in making it succeed.
2. **Make It Personal**: Leadership isn’t just about strategy. It’s about empathy. Recognizing the fears and challenges of the people you lead has a big impact.
3. **Be honest**: Great leaders don’t just paint an optimistic picture. They acknowledge reality and then give hope. Transparency fosters trust.

Leadership is not about command and control. It is about guiding and enabling others to reach their full potential.

So, the question is: How are *you* inspiring belief in those around you?
