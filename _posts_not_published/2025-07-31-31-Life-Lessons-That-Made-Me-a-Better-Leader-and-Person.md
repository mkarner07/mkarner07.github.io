Every once in a while, I come across a piece of content that sticks with me, not because it’s flashy, but because it’s *true*.

I recently watched [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7q8DpRN5Zk) that listed 31 life lessons, and I couldn’t help but nod in agreement. These weren’t groundbreaking ideas, but they were honest and relatable.

So I decided to reflect on them myself: adding in what I’ve learned through leading teams, raising a family, and navigating modern life with all its complexity.

Here they are (and it fits posting this on the 31st of July): **31 simple truths** that have helped me lead better, live more intentionally, and let things that don’t matter go.

### 1. **Energy matters more than time**

You can have all the time in the world, but without energy, it’s useless (as I wrote in [this article]({% post_url 2024-06-16-Managing-Energy-and-Not-Time %})). Focus on protecting your energy: through sleep, boundaries, movement, …

That’s what fuels real productivity.

### 2. **Don’t waste time on small decisions**

Not every choice needs a pros and cons list. If it’s reversible or low-stakes, just decide and move on. Save your brainpower for what truly matters.

### 3. **A little extra grooming goes a long way**

Taking care of yourself helps your confidence and signals to others that you show up with intention. Small habits (like flossing or skincare) compound.

### 4. **Cherish the time before major responsibilities**

If you’re not drowning in obligations yet, don’t take that time for granted. Use it to build, grow, and explore. Don’t sleepwalk through it.

### 5. **Big decisions usually aren’t**

What seems huge in the moment often looks minor in hindsight.

Don’t paralyze yourself.

When in doubt, act.

### 6. **You don’t need new stuff**

Contentment is underrated. Most “upgrades” don’t change much, especially not your satisfaction. Use what you have. Wear it out.

### 7. **If you enjoy something, do it**

Not everything needs to be monetized or productive. Hobbies are worth it just because they bring joy. That’s reason enough.

### 8. **Ask people to hang out**

It feels vulnerable, but do it. Most people want connection. The strongest friendships are often built one casual meetup at a time.

### 9. **You don’t have to optimize everything**

Life isn’t a math problem. Don’t lose yourself trying to automate every chore. Do the dishes. Wait in line. Be human.

### 10. **Minimalism isn’t the goal - contentment is**

You don’t have to throw out all your stuff to live intentionally (like toxic minimalism preaches). If your things bring you peace, that’s enough.

### 11. **Don’t travel just to travel**

Seeing the world is great. But so is staying home. Don’t feel like you need to collect passport stamps to have a meaningful life.

### 12. **Sleep is better than stimulants**

Coffee is great. And yes, I love it too. But nothing beats real rest. Sleep is the foundation. You can’t lead well if you’re chronically tired.

### 13. **Nothing good happens after midnight**

The later it gets, the lower the return (sometimes [already at 3 PM]({% post_url 2025-05-29-Why-Your-Worst-Decisions-Happen-at-3-PM %})). Whether it's work, play, or doomscrolling: cut it off and go to bed.

### 14. **Find exercise that feels like play**

I’ve tried lots of workouts, but I've only stuck with the ones I enjoyed ([running]({% post_url 2025-07-17-Why-I-Didnt-Give-Up-Running-My-First-Half-Marathon %})). Fitness doesn’t have to be punishment.

### 15. **Stopping is sometimes harder than starting**

Anyone can start something. But knowing when to stop - whether it’s a project or a habit - takes wisdom.

### 16. **Life is a series of experiments**

Thinking about a big change?

Try prototyping (see [Design Your Life methodology]({% post_url 2023-12-21-Sculpting-Your-Best-Year-Yet %})): try it for 30 days.

You’ll either love it or learn something. Both are wins.

### 17. **There are no rules**

You don’t have to follow the traditional path. Build your own timeline, your own version of success. That’s freedom.

### 18. **You don’t need an opinion about everything**

You’re allowed to say “I don’t know.” Leaders who do that earn more trust, not less.

### 19. **You don’t need to stay informed about everything**

You can’t carry the weight of the world. Choose where your attention goes. Focus doesn’t make you selfish. It makes you effective.

### 20. **Changing your mind is a sign of growth**

We reward stubbornness too much. Being open to new evidence or perspectives?

That’s real strength.

### 21. **Take care of your feet**

This sounds simple, but bad shoes will catch up with you. Invest in comfort. You’ll thank yourself later.

### 22. **Ignore fashion, or don’t**

Style is personal. If you like trends, follow them. If you’ve found your uniform, stick with it. Neither choice matters much.

### 23. **Get off social media**

Scrolling eats your time and chips away at your confidence. Delete it, or at least limit it. Your brain will feel clearer.

### 24. **Go for walks**

Walking solves so many problems: stress, brain fog, creative blocks. For me personally, this is more true with going for a run: I’ve never regretted a run.

### 25. **Buy once, cry once**

For things that matter (tools, shoes, gear, …), buy quality. You’ll save money and frustration long-term.

### 26. **Go deep**

Mastery takes time. Pick something (craft, leadership, art, …) and stick with it.

Depth beats dabbling.

### 27. **If you want kids, don’t wait forever**

Timing matters. If you know parenting is part of your path, make space for it. It’s hard, but definitely worth it. And if you have kids: [be present]({% post_url 2025-06-12-Parental-Leave-Isnt-Just-for-Moms-A-Fathers-Perspective %}).

### 28. **Apologize**

It doesn’t mean you’re wrong. It just means you value the relationship. I’ve never regretted saying “I’m sorry.”

### 29. **Always get in the water**

Ocean, lake, cold plunge: whatever it is, jump in. It wakes you up. It reminds you you’re alive.

### 30. **Popular ≠ good**

Don’t trust the algorithm. Great stuff is often hidden. Ask people you trust for recommendations. Go off the beaten path.

### 31. **Start lots of books, finish few**

Reading isn’t a race. If a book doesn’t speak to you, let it go.

Life’s too short to finish books you don’t enjoy.
