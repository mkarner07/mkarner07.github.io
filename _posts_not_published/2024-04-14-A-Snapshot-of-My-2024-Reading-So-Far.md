I’ve always enjoyed reading. Until some years ago I mostly read fiction.

After completing my PhD, I was still hungry for more knowledge. So I started reading more and more non-fiction. The spectrum ranged from physics and economics to productivity and self-improvement. But I also like to mix some novels into my reading list.

Reading is indeed an excellent form of learning

> Not all readers are leaders, but all leaders are readers. - Harry S. Truman
> 

I think this is true. Reading is like loading a new version of an operating system into your mind. It changes how you see the world and how you approach problem-solving - very important traits for a leader. For this year, my goal is to read 20 books, as I have summarized in [this article]({% post_url 2023-12-28-My-top-7-books-for-2024 %}). After the first quarter, I would like to draw a first conclusion.

## Books I’ve read in 2024

- **The Almanack of Naval Ravikant**: This was my first book for 2024. So far I’ve read many books on economy and wealth generation and I really liked the book. However, Navals standpoints are very controversial. If you want to know more about the book, you can check out my two deep dives on [5 Proven Ways to Unlocking Wealth and Wisdom]({% post_url 2024-03-17-5-Proven-Ways-to-Unlocking-Wealth-and-Wisdom %}) and [Improve Your Happiness with 6 Simple Strategies]({% post_url 2024-03-21-Improve-Your-Happiness-with-6-Simple-Strategies %}).
- **Grit**: The essence of the book is that perseverance (or “grit” as Angela Ducksworth calls it) trumps talent. This is actually very encouraging to know: with hard work and perseverance you can outpace talent. Furthermore, grit is nothing that is inherited - it can be learned! If you want to read more about grit, please check out my [article on the topic]({% post_url 2024-02-11-The-Power-of-Persistence %}).
- A parenting book
- The Richest Man in Babylon: Another book on wealth generation that has been sitting on my reading list for a while. It was the third book, I’ve read in 2024. Although it was a rather quick read, I think it isn’t worth the time. The teachings are very shallow and could be summarized in a page article.
- **So Good They Can’t Ignore You**: This book is the counterargument for the common *“follow your passion”* career advice. Cal Newport suggests that you should instead focus on developing rare and valuable skills to achieve career satisfaction and success. It is an engaging quick read that has some common points with Grit. If you are interested in Cal Newport's main points, you can check out [my article]({% post_url 2024-04-07-Why-following-your-passion-might-not-be-the-best-career-choice %}).
- **Good Inside**: The book is actually written for parents and it's packed with awesome parenting hacks! I'd totally recommend it to all parents out there! But it's not just for parents. It's got loads of cool leadership tips too!

## What’s next?

- **Can’t Hurt Me**: I’ve already read about three-quarters of the book and I am already stunned. It is great. To read about David Goggins's personal story is both: touching and instructive. It shows how you can draw energy, even when the odds are against you, and how to improve your resilience. I am already thrilled to finish the book and I’ll definitely summarize my learnings!
- **Don Quijote**: I’ve finished the first book of this Spanish masterpiece. It is really funny but has deeply thought-out characters.
- **Think Again**: After reading many books by Simon Sinek in 2023, I wanted to explore more books by his counterpart, Adam Grant. I’ve just started reading this book, so I can’t say much about it, but I’ll give you an update as soon as I’ve finished it.

So with the books I am currently reading, I am at 9 books. So until my goal of 20, there is still some room to cover, but I am confident that I’ll hit my reading target for 2024.

If you have any book recommendations, please share them in the comments - I’d be happy to check them out!
