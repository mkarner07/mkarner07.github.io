In the last two posts, we explored two powerful books on communication: *How to Talk to Anyone* by Leil Lowndes and *Supercommunicators* by Charles Duhigg. They both offer great insights, but they approach the art of communication from different angles.

Let’s break down how these two books compare, where they differ and when you should use which approach.

### The core philosophy

**Leil Lowndes** believes communication is a skill you can master through behavioral techniques. Her book is packed with 92 actionable tips to help you appear confident, charismatic, and likable.

**Charles Duhigg**, on the other hand, argues that great communication starts with understanding the *type* of conversation you're in (emotional, practical, or social) and adapting accordingly.

### Techniques vs. Frameworks

| Aspect | How to Talk to Anyone | Supercommunicators |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Style** | Prescriptive tips (e.g., “Sticky Eyes”, “The Big-Baby Pivot”, …) | Analytical frameworks (e.g., “Conversation Matching”) |
| **Focus** | First impressions, charisma, likability | Depth, clarity, emotional resonance |
| **Tools** | Behavioral tricks to appear confident and engaging | Cognitive tools to decode and adapt to conversation dynamics |

Lowndes gives you the *how*.

Duhigg gives you the *why*.

### How is this relevant to leadership?

If you're a leader looking to **build rapport quickly**, Lowndes’ techniques are ideal for networking, public speaking, and social influence.

If you're, on the other hand, navigating **team dynamics, or conflict resolution**, Duhigg’s frameworks help you understand and align with others more deeply.

### How is this relevant for productivity?

Lowndes helps you **streamline interactions** by making communication smoother and more efficient.

Duhigg helps you **prevent miscommunication** which ensures conversations are meaningful and productive.

### When to use which

- Use **Lowndes** when you need to **impress, connect, or persuade** in short bursts.
- Use **Duhigg** when you need to **understand, align, and resolve** in deeper conversations.

### Final thoughts

*How to Talk to Anyone* teaches us how to show up with confidence, charm and intention. It’s about making a strong impression and building trust The techniques are easy to apply and help you become more persuasive in everyday interactions.

*Supercommunicators* takes us deeper. It’s not just about talking. It’s about understanding. It’s about tuning into the emotional current of a conversation, asking better questions and recognizing when identity and values are at play. It gives you a framework to connect meaningfully, especially when the stakes are high or the topics are complex.

Together, these books offer a powerful toolkit for leaders and anyone who wants to communicate with more clarity and empathy.

So next time you’re in a conversation ask yourself:

- Am I making the other person feel seen?
- Do I know what kind of conversation we’re having?
- Am I listening to connect, not just to reply?

Because in the end, it’s not about talking more. It’s about talking smarter, listening deeper and building relationships that last.
