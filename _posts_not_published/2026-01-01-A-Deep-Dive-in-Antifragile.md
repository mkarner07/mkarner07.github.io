title: "A Deep Dive in Nexus"
description: "If you’ve ever wondered why humans dominate the planet (or why we might one day lose that dominance) Yuval Noah Harari’s Nexus offers a sobering answer: information systems have always shaped the way we cooperate, govern, and innovate. From cave paintings to artificial intelligence, Harari traces how these systems evolved and what that means for our future. If you are interested in the insights I’ve collected from the book, let’s grab a cup of coffee and dive into it."
