There are many strategies, methods, and guidelines to increase your productivity (the [GTD](https://medium.com/@matthiaskarner/inside-the-mind-of-getting-things-done-the-gtd-methodology-6f250251b421) method, Peter Drucker's [The Effective Executive](https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Effective+Executive), the [role of habits](https://medium.com/illumination/building-success-brick-by-brick-the-role-of-habits-1835e3033f52), …).

Recently I tried some methods I’ve picked up in  [Feel-Good Productivity](https://www.google.at/search?q=Feel-Good+Productivity) by Ali Abdaal.

One of the simplest ones is to ask yourself a single question:

**“How would this look like if it were any fun?”**

Why is this powerful?

How we feel about the things we are doing depends a lot on our mindset and how we approach certain things. If we start something thinking it won't be fun, it often ends up being exactly that - boring and not fun.

But if we ask ourselves how we could make a rather boring task fun we start with a positive mindset and often making something more fun can be as simple as e.g. turning on some music, making a game out of it, or doing it together with others.
