Efficiency and effectiveness are becoming more and more important to suceed in today‘s challenging corporate world.

In my quest to supercharge my personal productivity, I've embarked on a journey filled with page-turning books, self-experimentation, and the pursuit of game-changing insights. There exist many strategies for enhancing your personal productivity, spanning from crafting daily routines, emulating the habits of high achievers, to investing in different software tools.

However, in my case, the existing solutions didn't quite cut it, leading me to craft a customized productivity setup by blending elements from various approaches to perfectly match my needs.

In this article I want to show you my current productivity system: The Total Recall Productivity Method (TORP).

## Overview: Essential Parts of TORP

In a corporate job a productivity system has to fullfill the following needs: communication, task & time management as well as notetaking and knowledge management.

For TORP, I blended Luhmann’s “[Zettelkasten](https://niklas-luhmann-archiv.de/)” with the [PARA](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/)-Method, David Allen’s “[Getting Things Done](https://amzn.to/3tM3NbC)” and added a bit of my own twist to it.

How did I set it up?

In my job as an IT & Digitalization manager I use OneNote and for my personal projects I use Notion. For both applications I set-up the same system and I am sure the system also works for other softwares out there such as Obsidian, Evernote etc.

TORP in OneNote starts with a Notebook consisting of a handful of sections and section-groups.

- **Inbox**: This is where all notes written throughout the day go initially (before they are processed).
- **Tasklist**: This is where to-do lists live.
- **2022, 2023, …**: This is where notes are stored permanently once they are processed. It has subsections: 1 section per month.
- **PARA**: This is the knowledge management system - you can also call it “second brain”.

### The core of TORP: PARA Onepager

In a corporate setting the amount of different tasks you have to deal with on a daily basis can quickly become overwhelming. Switching from one topic to another, the human brain cannot keep up and has to drop important information from the working memory.

This can easily result in important information slipping your mind. I, for one, experienced this firsthand. This is why, in my humble opinion, a knowledge management system must be the core of a good productity system - TORP does that. The core of TORP in OneNote is a section called “PARA Onepager”. It is one page with a bunch of links to all your Projects, Areas, Ressources and Archives relevant to you.

Why is it a Onepager?

It is the most summarized form of all information stored within the system and it enables you to eyeball it very quickly.

When initiating your PARA Onepager, simply input the projects and areas that are currently on your plate or immediately come to mind. You can always make modifications later. Additional categories will naturally emerge when you can't locate a suitable one while processing a note.

In the "Projects" section, you'll find a bulleted list of all your ongoing projects, just like in the "Areas" section. You can also include additional meta-information on the Onepager. Nonetheless, maintaining tidiness and avoiding excessively long lists is crucial, ensuring that you present the full picture at a single glance.

Getting a more detailed picture of one of the topics is just one click away.

When you click on a project link, it will take you to another one-page summary dedicated to that specific project. To enhance the page's organization, it is subdivided into sections. The number of entries on this page can vary significantly. Smaller projects or categories may contain just a handful of links, while larger projects could span multiple pages brimming with links.

Another notable aspect of the project page is the ability to incorporate additional meta-information that might not be directly linked within a note or emerge from the content of multiple notes together.
