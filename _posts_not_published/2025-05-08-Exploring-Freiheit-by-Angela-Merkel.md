In November 2024 Angela Merkel published her autobiography *“Freiheit”*, or in English *“Freedom”*.

The book is more than just a look back at her time as Germany’s first female Chancellor. It’s a thoughtful exploration of the key moments in global politics during her leadership.

What I really enjoyed about the book is that Merkel doesn’t just tell the story. She reveals the emotions, reasoning, and internal struggles behind her decisions and critically reflects on them.

If you are interested in exploring the contents of the book together, let’s grab a cup of coffee and dive into it.

The article is a longer one - if you are just interested in the essentials, please check out the quick summary.

## **Quick Summary for those in a hurry**

In her book, Angela Merkel talks about her childhood, youth and studies in the German Democratic Republic (GDR or in German DDR) and how she decided to fight for freedom after the reunification by becoming politically active.

Her GDR past accompanied her first years in politics - she was often judged as “the woman from the East” and pigeonholed.

She reflects critically on her political actions when she was Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany. At the end of the 1990s, for example, she positioned herself in favor of the peaceful use of nuclear energy but changed her position after the reactor accident in Fukushima.

Merkel talks about the events during her political career, in particular:

- Financial Crisis: Preventing a run on the banks (deposit insurance).
- Euro Crisis: Germany demanded tough measures from Greece and maintained the “no-bail-out” clause.
- NATO: She justifies having voted against Georgia and Ukraine joining NATO and reflects several times on Russian policy and Putin as a person.
- Refugee crisis with the famous slogan “We can do it”.
- Free trade agreements (I guess she’s shocked about what happens at the moment in the USA under Trump’s presidency).

## **A happy childhood amidst uncertainty**

Merkel’s early years in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) were marked by both freedom and oppression.

As a pastor’s daughter, she faced the challenge of growing up in a society where religion and the state were not just strictly separated, but where people with connections to certain religious offices were kept down and spied on.

Yet, she recalls her childhood with fondness.

Even under the strict regime, her home was a safe and supportive place. Talking with her mother, spending time in nature, and having close friends helped her grow, even though the Stasi (GDR’s secret police) were always watching.

One moment that stayed with her happened in her last years of school. Her class chose to sing a socialist song in English - a small act of rebellion. But it led to serious talks with the school leaders, and Merkel was afraid it might hurt her chances of getting into university.

Fortunately, the punishment was mild, but the event was an early indication of the difficult balancing act between following one’s beliefs and the pressures of the state.

## **Studying physics: a search for truth**

Merkel’s decision to study physics in Leipzig was both practical and philosophical. In a country where political ideologies often distorted facts, Merkel chose a subject that was grounded in reality: the natural sciences.

In her view, physics was a domain where the truth could not be manipulated even by the political forces of the GDR. So it offered her an opportunity for intellectual freedom.

While her academic journey was challenging, it also provided a sense of purpose to her.

She describes the rigorous academic environment as exactly what she had hoped for: a place where performance and results mattered more than ideological alignment.

During her time at university, Merkel met Ulrich Merkel, whom she would later marry. The couple hoped to secure jobs in the same location after their studies (it was common for graduates in the GDR to be assigned jobs by the state).

However, it wasn’t long before her political and social affiliations became a point of contention. When she applied for a doctoral position, her membership in an evangelical student group led to the authorities questioning her loyalty.

She was even approached by the Stasi to become an informant, an offer she rejected, which ultimately cost her the position.

However, she was fortunate and found a different way to pursue her academic ambitions and was granted a doctoral position elsewhere: at the Academy of Sciences in Berlin.

## **Navigating the political landscape of East Germany**

After completing her PhD in physical chemistry in 1985, Merkel’s career continued at the Academy of Sciences in East Berlin.

But life in East Germany wasn’t free from the shadow of politics.

The political landscape was pervasive: even academic careers were influenced by party loyalty and research travel (to the West) was contingent on maintaining good relations with the state apparatus. For someone with Merkel's background, neither of these conditions was easy to meet.

Despite these challenges, the 1980s also marked a period of relative relaxation under Mikhail Gorbachev’s leadership in the Soviet Union.

Merkel was even granted permission to travel to West Germany for family events (this would’ve been unthinkable some years earlier). It was during this time of relative openness that Merkel witnessed the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989, an event that would radically reshape the future of Germany and also her life.

## Unity and responsibility: Angela Merkel’s path into politics

After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Merkel was motivated by a new sense of possibility and joined the party *Demokratischer Aufbruch* (DA) rather than the established Social Party, quickly rising to press spokesperson. Despite setbacks, such as the DA’s poor election results after revelations about its leader’s Stasi ties, Merkel remained committed.

After the DA merged with the CDU, Merkel successfully ran for parliament in a rural district, establishing her political home in Vorpommern-Rügen. As Minister for Women and Youth, she championed equality and childcare rights, later reflecting that today *she would call herself a feminist “in her own way”*.

Der Fortschritt existiert, auch wenn er eine Schnecke ist. - Angela Merkel

I really like this quote from her, it means so much as “progress exists although it moves at the speed of a snail”.

In her role as Minister for the Environment, Merkel faced tough challenges, notably around nuclear policy and international climate negotiations. Rising within the CDU during a turbulent time, she navigated difficult decisions, including stepping aside for Edmund Stoiber as the 2002 chancellor candidate.

Her next big milestone: becoming Germany’s first female chancellor in 2005.

## The early days of leadership: a new era for Germany

Merkel begins by recounting the moment she was elected as Germany’s first female chancellor in 2005.

Angela Merkel talks about how deeply it affected her to be chosen as the leader of a united Germany after the Cold War. She felt the huge responsibility of the role.

Early in the book, Merkel contrasts the personal significance of the position with the rigid and repetitive routines of governance - weekly cabinet meetings, international summits, and the ongoing demands of representing Germany’s interests on the world stage. Even though much of the job was full of rules and red tape, she shows that true leadership comes from sticking to your values.

Angela Merkel’s way of leading was practical and shaped by her background in science. All through the book, one clear message stands out: good decisions should be based on facts, clear thinking, and the courage to act: even when it’s hard or unpopular.

## Leading through crisis: The challenges of the 2007 financial crisis, the Eurozone crisis, and beyond

One of the things that really shaped Angela Merkel’s time as Chancellor was how she handled crisis after crisis - especially the 2007 financial meltdown and the Eurozone debt drama that followed.

As banks wobbled and economies teetered, Merkel had to make some tough calls. In her book, she’s honest about how hard it was to agree to bank bailouts using taxpayer money. But for her, the bigger picture mattered more: stopping the economy from crashing completely. It wasn’t a popular move, but it showed one of her core beliefs: *that leadership means doing the right thing, not just the easy thing.*

Then came the Eurozone crisis.

Greece was drowning in debt, and Merkel stood firm on a key principle: Germany wouldn’t simply pay off another country’s bills. Still, she helped shape a deal: financial help for Greece, but only if they agreed to serious spending cuts. It was a delicate balancing act between fairness, stability, and political pressure from all sides.

Through it all, Merkel stayed true to her calm, careful style. She wasn’t looking for applause, just for steady hands and smart decisions when the stakes were sky-high.

## The refugee crisis: a defining moment for European unity and freedom

One of the biggest tests of Angela Merkel’s leadership came in 2015, during the refugee crisis.

As thousands of people fled war and danger, arriving at Europe’s borders with nothing but hope, Merkel made a bold choice.

She opened Germany’s doors and said the words that would define her stance: *“Wir schaffen das”* (“We can do this”). It wasn’t just a slogan. It was a statement of values: that helping those in need was simply the right thing to do.

In *Freiheit*, she reflects on this moment with honesty and depth. She never wavers on the belief that offering protection was Germany’s moral responsibility. But she didn’t ignore the storm that followed.

There was backlash.

Political tension.

A rise in populism and far-right anger.

And cracks in European unity became all too visible.

Looking back, Merkel admits it wasn’t easy and that not everyone agreed with her. But through the chaos, she held fast to a simple idea: that human dignity matters.

Even when the logistics are hard.

Even when the politics get ugly.

Sometimes, leadership means standing your ground, even when the ground is shaky.

## The politics of freedom: a global lens

Throughout *Freiheit*, Merkel explores the evolving definition of freedom in a globalized world.

As she reflects on the political landscape, she repeatedly highlights the importance of democratic values, the rule of law, and the protection of individual rights - principles that she believes form the bedrock of not just German society, but of the broader European project.

In her view, freedom is *the* core value of democracy, and it is only when these two concepts are upheld together that societies can truly thrive.

Merkel’s tenure also coincided with rising global challenges, including the rise of populism, the erosion of multilateralism, and the increasing influence of authoritarian regimes. Her reflections on global politics are marked by a concern for the future of liberal democracy and the strength of international institutions.

Merkel doesn’t mince words when it comes to Russia’s Vladimir Putin. In *Freiheit*, she’s clear-eyed and critical about his growing authoritarianism. She also reflects on the rise of China: not just as an economic powerhouse, but as a challenge to democratic values on the global stage.

Still, even with all the tension, Merkel stays true to one of her core beliefs: talk it out.

For her, diplomacy isn’t about agreeing. It’s about keeping the conversation going, especially when it’s hard. Because sometimes, the most important thing you can do in politics is simply stay at the table.

## The pandemic: a crisis of leadership and humanity

In the final chapters of *Freiheit*, Merkel turns to one of the toughest tests of her leadership: the COVID-19 pandemic.

With her science background, she met the crisis with calm and clarity.

Facts came first.

She listened to experts, acted quickly, and made public health a top priority. But she also knew that every lockdown, every restriction, had a human cost.

Merkel shares how Germany tried to strike a balance: slowing the virus while protecting people’s freedoms and livelihoods. Her tone is thoughtful and deeply empathetic, never losing sight of the people behind the policies.

What really shines through is her belief that strong leadership doesn’t mean having all the answers.

It means being honest, adaptable, and guided by compassion. In the chaos of a global pandemic, Merkel held firm to the idea that when we face hardship together, we come out stronger.

## Conclusion and personal thoughts

*Freiheit* closes with Angela Merkel looking back on her time in office — not just through the lens of what she did, but why she did it.

For her, freedom isn’t just about living without fear. It’s about ***actively protecting democracy, human dignity, and the rule of law***. Every day. Even when it’s hard.

The book is a quiet but firm reminder: real leadership means making tough choices for the greater good, even if they come with a personal or political price.

As Merkel steps off the world stage, her legacy is clear: a steady, thoughtful leader who faced crisis after crisis with calm, courage, and a deep belief in democratic values.

In *Freiheit*, she not only recounts those turning points but shares a vision for the future. A future where freedom and responsibility are two sides of the same coin.

Whether it’s the refugee crisis, global diplomacy, or the pandemic, Merkel’s reflections remind us that leadership isn’t about ego or headlines. It’s about clarity, courage, and compassion - especially when the path forward is anything but easy.

In the end, *Freiheit* is more than a memoir.

It’s an invitation. A call to everyone who believes in democracy and human rights to stay engaged, to keep going, and to never take freedom for granted.
