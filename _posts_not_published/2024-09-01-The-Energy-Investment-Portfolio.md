No matter how many productivity hacks you try, there’s always a limit to how productive you can be: **your energy**.

That's why it’s crucial to manage your energy, not just your time.

In a [recent article](https://medium.com/the-shortform/managing-energy-and-not-time-d9203a59eb8b), I discussed how to plan your week by not only scheduling time blocks but also considering energy blocks. If you want a long-term perspective on planning your energy, this handy method exists: *The Energy Investment Portfolio*.

Think of managing your energy like managing investments – there are two types:

- long-term investments (your dreams)
- short-term ones (going to the gym, working on a project, …)

You can have as many long-term goals as you want, but it's important to limit your short-term tasks to a manageable number, ideally fewer than 10. If you take on too many short-term tasks, you won't have enough energy to do them well or make real progress.

It's crucial to prioritize.

The Energy Investment Portfolio is a strategy I’ve learned from Ali Abdaal's productivity strategies he shows in [Feel-Good Productivity](https://medium.com/illumination/a-summary-of-feel-good-productivity-493cbcbb6e3b).
