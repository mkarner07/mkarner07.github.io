I used to think that the limit to how productive I could be was the time I had to do some kind of work. After discovering and incorporating many productivity methods and techniques, it came to a point where time wasn’t the limiting factor anymore, but energy was.

How do you overcome that?

When planning your week, don’t just allocate time blocks, but also energy blocks. Assure that there aren’t too many energy-draining activities and if there are, follow them up with lighter ones!
