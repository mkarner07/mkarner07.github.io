Why?

This simple question packs a punch. It’s more powerful than “How?” or “What?” because it digs deeper into why we do what we do: our true motivation and purpose. It’s the heart of our vision.

In his bestselling book *Start With Why*, Simon Sinek explains why putting “Why” at the core of your vision is crucial. His “golden circle” is eye-opening, and the book is packed with motivational insights and easy-to-follow tips for focusing on your “Why.”

I loved the book, and in this article, I’m excited to share the key takeaways that struck me. Ready to explore? Let’s get started!

## The golden circle

The golden circle is a simple concept.

It consists of three layers: At its center, there is the why. At the next level is the how and on the outside is the what.

Traditionally, we focus on the “What?”:

- What needs to be done?
- What is the price?
- What do we want to achieve?
- …

But these questions shouldn’t be the first thing we are after.

*This is not opinion, this is biology. - Simon Sinek*

With this statement, Sinek emphasizes that we humans have an inherent feeling of having to belong to a group. This feeling comes from the limbic system, which is also responsible for decision-making.

To influence people on a deeper level, you must communicate from the inside out (Why → How → What).

You have to start with the “Why”.

## The power of “Why”

We trust people who seem authentic because they openly share their “Why.”

When there are no hidden agendas or unclear motives, their honesty makes their intentions clear. This authenticity creates trust and helps us feel more confident in them.

This can be risky because you need to share something deeper.

Take companies for example: While many focus on the "What" they do, focusing on “Why” instead can be risky in fast-changing markets where products and services quickly become outdated.

However, the success of companies like Apple and Southwest Airlines shows that having a strong “Why” goes beyond what you offer. It provides a deeper, more enduring foundation that stays relevant even as specific products or strategies evolve.

### Case 1: Apple

Simon Sinek, a big fan of Apple, highlights the company as a good example of why focusing on your "Why" is crucial for lasting success.

Their “Why” is: to challenge the status quo and think differently. The company's core purpose is to create innovative, user-friendly technology that empowers individuals and enhances their lives.

This vision drives everything Apple does, from design and functionality to customer experience. Especially the customer experience has always been at Apple’s core, often prioritized over technical details.

### Case 2: Southwest Airlines

Southwest Airlines' “Why” revolves around delivering low-cost and reliable air travel that makes flying accessible and enjoyable for everyone (customers and employees), or in particular:

- Treat employees well and foster a supportive work environment.
- Prioritizing customer satisfaction illustrates how a clear purpose can lead to sustainable success and a loyal customer base.

And just as a good vision should be, their “Why” is deeply woven into their operational practices.

## Key takeaways from Start With Why

### The Why needs the How

There are generally two types of people: Why people and How people.

How people can succeed without a strong "Why." However, they often don’t achieve groundbreaking results like billion-dollar companies or major movements.

Why people, on the other hand, have big visions, but they cannot make them reality on their own. They need the support of how people who believe in their vision. Without this collaboration, they’ll most likely stay unfulfilled dreamers.

When Why and How people join forces, amazing things can happen. For example, at Apple, Steve Jobs provided the “Why,” while Steve Wozniak handled the “How” and the result was one of the most valuable companies on earth.

### Innovation

For innovations to succeed, you must win over the innovators and early adopters. If they are excited about new products, only then the early and late majority will follow. The latter two groups need personal recommendations from people who have tested the "new thing" themselves.

The best way to convince innovators and early adopters is a strong Why (not just a What).

### Sustain the Why

Simon Sinek highlights the history of Walmart.

When the founder was alive, he safeguarded Walmart’s mission to serve people and provide affordable groceries.

However, after his death, this “Why” faded, and the company became more focused on profits and less on its original mission. This shift to prioritizing the “What” has contributed to Walmart’s negative reputation lately and might impact its long-term profitability as well.

*Split happens. - Simon Sinek*

A split is a moment in the history of a company when the Why and What diverge. This can happen, for example, when the founder leaves the company (Apple, Walmart, Dell, etc.).

Another scenario is rapid company growth. If a company expands so quickly that it can’t effectively communicate its “Why” to all its employees and customers, the “Why” loses its impact.

In this case, even a strong founder's presence might not be enough to maintain a successful, “Why”-driven company anymore. At such a development stage, the “Why” has to be woven into the company culture already.

### Implement your Why

*If you follow your Why, then others will follow you. - Simon Sinek*

- **Define your core purpose**: Start by clearly identifying your “Why”. Reflect on what drives you, both personally and professionally.
- **Align your goals**: When setting objectives, ask yourself if they support your core purpose.
- **Communicate your “Why”**: Share your purpose with others. Whether it's with your team, colleagues, or friends.
- **Make decisions through the lens of your “Why”**: Use your “Why” as a filter for decision-making. This approach ensures integrity in your actions.
- **Create a supportive environment**: Build a network of individuals who understand and resonate with your “Why”. Their encouragement and feedback can help you stay on track.
- **Regularly adapt**: Review your “Why” and assess if it still aligns with your goals and actions.

## **Conclusion**

Grasping and focusing on your “Why” is more than just a strategy.

It brings clarity, motivation, and a deep sense of purpose. And it is more than that: if you have a vision and communicate it, you can create a following.

So, in conclusion, take time to reflect on your own “Why” in your professional life, personal life, or both. It will shed new light on your sense of purpose and it might just be the foundation for your extraordinary journey.
